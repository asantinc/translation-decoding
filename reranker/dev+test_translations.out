at a hearing in the city council last month , the schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 reported that they have the notice claims , department of education , warning that filed against him ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce the formal filing suit in state supreme court in manhattan .

president felipe calderon 's sister , it seems , has made its bid for the governor 's seat michoacan during the fierce state election , and she said on monday that the traffickers have helped to tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents .
" interference by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not only for the michoacan , but also for the whole country , " said luisa maria calderon in радиоинтервью on the day sunday after the vote .
pri ruled mexico for seven decades , is not yet lost the presidency in 2000 .
calderon , national action party candidate , or ipa , headed by her brother , refused to acknowledge вальехо winner .
ауреолес also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
in michoacan has long dominated drug cartels , in marijuana , heroin and метамфетаминах .
for the pri , however , no matter how badly looked elections in michoacan , victory will give momentum behind the party .
раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must do " everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia can be up to some extent is protected , but she ca n't be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he could bring the world economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can , " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and decline in foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .
" at some point , they will know that the greeks are retiring in 50 years and go on holidays to the sea , and it will not be perceived well , " he said .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields battlefield in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong decline , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "
" while foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff would be reduced , which will lead to опозданиям staff with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to the pentagon 's budget compromise or strengthen calls for release from cutbacks , will see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with a shell , but without the core .
" with this paper tiger , the army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , can accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense project may encounter obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only on the early stages of planning .
stopping further development and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that is a vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the tests in school and college is the norm .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in a single day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not worth of hard to conclude that liars do notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , a laugh , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complex question completely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering the complicated issue : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

administration headed by former european commissioner monti must approve the austerity package demanded european leaders in order to regain confidence in italy .
emma марчегалия , leader of the italian employers ' federation , told reporters after meeting with monti : " we were told that we will actively support this government " .
monti 's chances of success were largely based on the support of party the ldp prime minister silvio berlusconi , who was forced to resign saturday due to the crisis .

in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , said that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition both at high , and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his характерное вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , but change throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperatures , specializing in chemical engineering said .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
when vehicles and прикладывании efforts , it helps forces of very well be on the road to cover .

nuclear industry извлечет lessons from this accident as the learned from the previous two .
as it is seen all specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift to competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) said that " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people who will determine our future , may 2011 , princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
influenced by fears of immigrants based on the view that they can replace the local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking wage declines .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - dynamic sectors , where the training are not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the labor organization , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) , on average , 150 000 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to vote and make it as direct as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become the " tool of suppression , " as when a republican philosopher etienne вашро .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом order .
no , we are dreaming not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty , europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with each of its nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , extricating itself from the markets , and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , had to " create a " republican .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe at the political level , this popular european sovereignty .
in fact , the 2011 completed 11 % sales growth of the world bank cards , mobile phones with chips ( sim - cards ) , above , according to eurosmart , 6 thousand million units .
this year in the world will be sold in the 460 million smart cards against бесконтактных 320 million a year earlier .
europe lagged a long time from the asia - pacific region , now moving forward in the field of бесконтактных payments .
france starts off with more modest positions : in circulation are 400,000 бесконтактных visa cards .
this year , carrefour released 2.5 million бесконтактных pass mastercard .
" two large organizations in france promised in the future systematically to distribute among their customers ' bank cards , suited for non - use , " said gerard небуи , ceo of visa europe france .
but this is only the first stage of development in the future means of payment , then there is a mobile phone .
" we 're looking at a global sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , " explains mark бертен , head of eurosmart .
crédit agricole yesterday announced the experiment from december to june next year in the massacre .
подтвердились long предполагавшиеся ties between the terrorist group al qaeda in islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) and the nigerian sect boko haram .
" the way in which use these two organizations , and intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperate , " he explained , without the details .
among debris left after the surgery , french and нигерские , investigators found a few telephone sim card belonging to the terrorists .
analysis of the place calls , has pointed out several находившихся in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but surely , you have to wait for more reliable evidence , before we talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years already , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more intense , " says кунле амуво , a nigeria researcher .
the international community , led by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the challenges posed by boko haram .
it focused mainly on the churches , bars and authorities .
in the last christmas it claimed responsibility for share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then for one more in abuja .
in august , the local office of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when aqmi has in mali and niger , but somalis of al-shabaab are boko haram in kenya , a new threat to the continent .
whether weary with crisis america can lead a complex world with simple , or rather simplistic ideas ?
for a few days , mitt romney , the херман kain , rick perry and other множат loud , but without details of claims on foreign policy , which are traditionally strong republicans .
mitt romney , who has the best chances of nomination from the " good old parties " , has threatened to sue chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of manipulating its currency is a sensitive issue for america , irritated migration for their industries to asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only candidate , the complex foreign policy could not overcome position that потакает emotions .
but huntsman , who has been at the bottom of the ratings , remained неуслышанным .
romney also promised military strikes on iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur херман caine , the second ranking candidates demonstrated the обескураживающее ignorance .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and to the military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use the us army against drug cartels in mexico .
all this is a far cry from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy .
they remind us that obama was himself a lover and that he had to reduce tone about the fight against terror .
after iraq , it does not believe the military intervention , that увязают in the sand .
the north stream , new gates for the entry of russian gas to europe .
he is on the supply of gas equivalent of 30 million households .
more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and government participated in last tuesday on the shores of the baltic sea , between orchestra and exquisite performance snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , a new gas pipeline , which directly links russia and germany under water .

" we close the flow of gas in the case of accident less than a minute , " says jens muller .
but this seems unlikely that piping designers seams , designed for протечку only once in 100,000 years .
сигароообразный аппарат introduced a 1 - meter diameter pipeline inside and pushed forward the flow of gas .
gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for any repairs .
these five companies created a joint venture , called the northern flow , which has been commissioned to build and operate gas pipeline .
then gazprom gave the company leases the twenty years with the possibility of extension of the entire gas transportation .
natural gas pipeline was financed by 30 % shareholders and 70 % of bank loans .
gas pipeline out of the baltic sea in любмине on the sandy beach , засаженный coniferous trees .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before sucked it in german gas pipelines .
at full capacity it will be 3 million an hour , and 6 million in 2012 .
