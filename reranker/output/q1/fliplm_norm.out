one of the reasons for secrecy was a lesson learned the city .
in the operation on tuesday attended by members of the various police units , including forces from the districts - team police officers , who usually used for control of the criminal окрестными district .
" correctly was to do this then , when in the park is less of the entire people , " he said .

police said that tents not touched until 1:45 a.m. , giving protesters pack .
but many journalists argue that they do n't have to see how operates police , and that the police treated them rudely .
when police went to the west through a pile of personal belongings antifiltration protesters , including bags , plastic mats and bags full of clothing , the health department followed the team , it was collecting what брошено .

school employees union , representing hundreds of staff , who lost their seats in the past month , plans to sue the city wednesday , arguing that the layoffs were not needed and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate influence on schools , where poor students attend .
six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other officials , who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on october 7 as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to their refusal to give access to medical city funds , manageable groups workers , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 reported that they approached with the notice claims , the department of education , warning that against him filed ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce formal filing suit in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokesman for the city 's legal department , said that city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions .
he points out that , while the статен - island layoffs was not , and schools in upper east side or трибеки their was little , 17 ancillary workers schools lost seats in the district 23 in браунсвилле , brooklyn , and 46 was forced to resign in the districts 8 and 9 in the south bronx .
p.s. budget 36th was scrapped on 3,26 percent this year , and she also lost money , when the city has changed the way of counting the additional funding on each poor student , who is enrolled in school .
in the notification used the word " excess " , although about " excessive " more often , when a teacher from payroll schools moves in the list of available workers , wages , which pays for the central office .
all is that it took to the rebellion failed , a longtime dictator muammar qaddafi was taken prisoner and murdered , and the american intervention concluded .
" meaning this resolution to commend the honors отважному people of libya , when they begin to rebuild their country , " said kerry .
language may seem harmless , but still no discussion on libya was not easy .
kerry and mccain introduced a resolution in june , allows limited use of american forces in libya .
but the same day , when the bill failed in the house of representatives , the chamber also supported a proposal that would not cut funding for u.s. operations in libya .
resolution " admires the people of libya 's foreign affairs committee for his incredible bravery and formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanked the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners , who participated in military operations to protect the libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism . "

this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives bob гудлатом ( republican , virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or than any other , which will be on the plenary vote this congress convening .
amendment гудлата - only one of 68 , constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues , which were made in this convening .
there are at least 15 versions of the amendments on a balanced budget only in the house of representatives and even how much something about " control of federal spending . "
the budget control act , which passed in august , demanded that the house of representatives , and the senate voted about a balanced budget amendment .
in addition to the budget , some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of authority of the members of congress , and a member of the house of representatives , jose serrano ( democrat , new york ) wants to abolish the restriction in two terms for president .
amendment banning same - sex marriages offer already as many years , and another , banning burning the flag .
as neither aspired to members of congress to propose amendments , they are not faster , than in years past .
this rate pales when compared to the beginning of the 1990s , members of congress , according to the library regularly offered more than 150 amendments to the senate every two years .
the latest amendment , which was adopted , the 27 - i - was approved by parliament in 1992 , but in congress it was actually in 1789 .

nothing new : two judges attend the event society федералистов for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the sheer intimacy scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to the company with big financial interests , it was sufficient signal for the activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official shares fundraising with lawyers , things which are now viewed in court " .
scalia and thomas is unlikely to pay attention to critics who say that they very readily mixed case with the court фигурирующими in matters of groups like society federalists .
moreover , conservatives argue that it is in relation to the judge elena kagan ethical question arises , rather than the scalia and thomas .

" asia may be protected to some extent , but she may not be invulnerable . "
european monetary union was badly undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the world economy into recession again , and led to calls for leading economies gather together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do all that can " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is experiencing now declining exports and reducing foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help the wealthy europeans , when they faced their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction from the pentagon corridors to fields battlefield in afghanistan , on the line and to civil assembly .
" the consequences of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" such a strong reduction , so , make most of our projects кораблестроению repressions and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "
" although the military funding in overseas contingency operations not affected directly секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям staffer with payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defense will become the fastest decline in the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not exit , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves " .
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to pentagon budget compromise or inflame calls for release from cutbacks , see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may follow farther -- troops from a shell , but without the kernel .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army , with barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said , in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may encounter obstacles , including those who passed the tests , and only some in the early stages of planning .
termination of the further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that it is vitally important next step to improve and confront potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly hid that retired football coach raped young boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was indicted in financial fraud during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud charges on exams in high school and college - standard affair .
mentors , who must teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
within one of the day , as studies show , you may lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that people unfamiliar солгали three times for the first 10 minutes with each other dating .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
not worth it from doing this conclusion , that liars hard notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiation or management .
we know from research that extroverts than introverts lied more frequently , that men are more lie about yourself , whereas women -- about the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой laughter , voice characteristics , your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when trying to recall their history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , change their position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in a speech : " i did not have sexual relations with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification " language , when responding to a complex question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... how i know . "
there is no magical funds , to expose the lie , but to master the skill detection of deception can be .

then administrative harassment of foreign students , which was in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) , said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french economy and immigration for french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .

and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates great proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - all were founded immigrants ) .
world labor organization estimates that in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in the average 150 000 euros .

no , we dream not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but gradually loses its sovereignty , and the entire europe along with her each of its nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , extricating itself from the markets , and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish the republic , france needed to " create " republicans .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe on the political level , this popular european sovereignty .
