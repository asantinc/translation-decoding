mentors who must teach opposite , sent a message that lies and fraud finds acceptable .
within one day , as studies show that , you could lie from 10 up to 200 times .

unlike games room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " identification of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
not worth from doing this conclusion that liars difficult note and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts that men are more lie about themselves , while women -- about others , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complex question completely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering the complicated issue : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magical means deception detection , to detect the lies , but to master the skill you can .

why you continually remodeling words in the yellow ledbetter for gigs ?
he sings it and , i think he uses the first thing that comes him in the head .
so many of them that i can speak all day about басистах who i love .
i think we all feel some оторванность from words гранж .
initially your music was much more grim , but now she became more positive .
this is interesting , because , i think , there are several songs on this album , which may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end or just breathe , which are considered very grim , though they may sound a bit positive .
i think that when you grow , and in your life was some trauma and you lost family member or friend , these events are beginning to influence your creativity and your music and these two songs , of course , reflect this for me .

as remind us economists ian goldin and jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of influence immigrants based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , especially skilled , provoking lowering salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - dynamic sectors , where learning are not connected with the proposals work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants that the arrival of the immigrants , leads to positively affect wages local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates great proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - all were founded immigrants ) .
according to the labor organization , for example , in germany , an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) on average 150 000 euros .
referred teeth , which used to scaring immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is very valuable acquisition ; but simultaneously and fragile .
some thought that to democracy finally triumphed over their enemies , enough to vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , even though and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as once - republican philosopher etienne said вашро .
the european crisis that we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but this primarily a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we 'll win nothing , demanding a series of national referendums , organized by as the need and in хаотическом order .
no , we dream not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
whole europe subject to dictates markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and from the absence of solidarity .
many worried about the transfer of sovereignty europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and , together with her each nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , extricating itself from the markets , and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a long discussion of this proposals socialists and jacques delors now require all european economic government .
but represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
to install republic of france , needed to be " create " republican .
this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , real people 's european sovereignty .
in fact , 2011 will be completed 11 % rise in the world sales microprocessors ( bank cards , mobile phones with sim - cards ) , above , according to eurosmart , 6 thousand million units .
this year , 460 million in the world will be sold бесконтактных chip - cards against 320 million a year earlier !
europe , which lagged for a long time from asia - pacific region , are now moving forward in the field бесконтактных payments .
france starts with the more modest positions : in circulation are 400.000 бесконтактных cards visa .
carrefour in this year released a 2.5 million бесконтактных pass mastercard .
" two large organizations in france promised in the future systematically distribute among their clients , bank cards , suited for non use , " said gerard небуи , director general of the visa europe france .
but it is only first stage of development in the future means of payment , i.e. , mobile phone .
" we count on global sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , " explains mark бертен , head of eurosmart .
yesterday crédit agricole announced the experiment with december through june next year in cana .

" way , which use these two organizations , and reports secret services show that they are actively collaborating , " he explained , without going into details .
among the wreckage , the remaining after the operation , french and нигерские , investigators found a few telephone sim - cards , belonging to terrorists .
analysis occurred calls pointed out at several interlocutors , 58/89 in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this step forward , but , surely , we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before we talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years , it is known that sect receives financial and идейную support from outside and that she is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , a nigerian researcher .
the international community headed by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , they pay attention to the problems that creates boko haram .
she focused mostly on the churches , bars and authorities .
in the past christmas she took responsibility for share , resulting in which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then for one more in abuja .
in august the local representation united nations would become their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to continent .
