observe позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can secure the top of his body when trying to remember its history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all complicated questions behind .

someone might use the " qualification language " , when the complex question : " well ... in truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "

when we have two or three songs that we do not played for some time , it keeps us alert and surprised us , because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we could .
we are happy our удачам and we are encouraged that we can to continue to make music together .
we are happy to places in the world , where we always wanted to go .
does that mean for you to be part of the heyday of grunge ?
we good friends with his friends from soundgarden , mudhoney and the alice in chains .

i still have with several of these from time to time .
also very strange that the group such as your remains together and in the same lineup as a long time .
first , i think we are lucky we are still alive , and secondly , we discount the others .
we trust each other 's music , and all could not be better .
we care about , not to be too long on the tour , because large crowds is easy to get involved in this game and people who enjoy your music .

he sings it and , i think he uses the first thing that comes him in the head .
so many of them that i can speak all day about басистах who i love .
i think we all feel some оторванность from the word гранж .
at first your music was more dismal , and now it has become more positive .
it 's interesting , as i think , there are a few songs on this album that may seem easier , but there are songs like the end or just breathe , which are considered very grim , though they may sound a bit positive .
i think when you grow , and in your life was some trauma and you have lost family member or friend , these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music , and the two , of course , reflect this for me .

to calm the situation in his party , the chancellor has increased its number of references to the konrad adenauer and helmut kohl , but it did not aim to influence congress due to the " small " european countries or , in a precarious position that love to criticize the " arrogant " germany .
in fact , it was one of the most humiliating defeats napoleonic army .

the average , which hides some deviation ; another study published in 2007 the site about career management monster.com , showed that 75 % of the 40,000 french workers surveyed said that they did n't take a single day of the hospital .
if we compare these figures with figures european neighbours , it seems that the french workers do not are more likely to take sick than workers any other country .
level of fraud due to the sick leave , is very low compared to " grey " employment .
law following the 2002 led to systematic verification of hospital lasting more than 45 days .
in the case of systematically проверяемых hospital sheets for more than 45 days from 1.2 million 11 % were " inappropriate or unfounded " , equivalent to 132 000 .

insee reduction figures , despite this , in second quarter , with the slump in 0.1 % of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) instead of stagnation .
germany , in turn , the growth of 0.5 % over the same period .
if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a very short discussion or under the influence of emotions , is energy policy .
this healthy trend that the election meetings are an occasion for reflection on share and place their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and rational data .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources to continue electricity production continuously , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from environmental debate .
this is why germany only one in its decision to renounce nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , are just few of those who strongly continues to their projects .
although german model based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind which carbon emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy the price of energy a key factor in competitiveness and service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefit from the cheap electricity in europe .
price majority of the french refuse to pay the more because they do not oppose this type of energy in principle .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a whole contemporaries specialized on international trade small and medium - sized enterprises and created many jobs that may not be moved to another industry .
any engineer - electrician will order epr , calculated to work 60 years old , if the planned closure of its maker ?
development of areva solutions with low - carbon , nuclear and renewable , shows взаимодополнимости sources of energy .
in france we have security body that monitors existing , too , and transparent energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years atomic industry experienced three serious incident .
in chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error led to the tragedy .
nuclear industry will lessons from the accident , as learned from two previous .
as it is all the specialists in the field of energy to build a reactor , stop its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь to leadership in imminent development of nuclear energy .
then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when interior minister ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) said that france " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration burden to the french economy and for french society .
in its programme in francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wage and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants based on the view that they can to replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking wage declines .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - dynamic sectors , where training linked to the proposals work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants that the arrival of the immigrants , leads to positively affect wages local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to labor organization , for example , in germany , an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus costs ) an average of 150,000 euros .
referred teeth , which used to scaring immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but both fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over its enemies , a vote and make it as direct as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become the " tool of suppression , " as when a republican philosopher etienne вашро .
the european crisis that we are experiencing , is the economic crisis , but first , this political crisis and crisis democracy .
we win nothing , demanding series of national referenda , organized as needed and хаотическом .
no , we are dreaming not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on level .
the entire europe subject to dictates markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer europe , but the entire europe gradually lose their sovereignty , and with it each of her nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , free from markets and prepare for future , investing in them .
after a long discussion of the proposal socialists and jacques delors now require all european economic government .
but represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
to install republic of france , needed to be " create " republican .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe at the political level , this popular european sovereignty .
in fact , 2011 will 11 percent sales growth of the world microprocessors ( bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , above , according to eurosmart , 6 thousand million .
