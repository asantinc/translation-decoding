more than one - third of children ages 9 to 13 years weigh more norms ; while 9 % of schoolchildren are overweight , 5 % are obese .
we again see the importance of the environment , and behaviors related man to his or her healthy development .
more than 19 per cent of children suffering from obesity , ate for dinner , french fries on the eve of the poll of educational event called obesity is not accidental .
event obesity is not a coincidence was conducted for the second consecutive year , backed by insurance company všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and unilever 's .
nutrition and enough sports are the main factors causing fast - growing number of children who suffer from excess body weight , or obesity .
in the czech republic only 23 % families schoolboys завтракают together .
worse discovery was that in every tenth family people not завтракают at all .
study showed that more fried food in families with children , with obesity .
although more than 40 % of children regularly exercise , this figure is down more than doubled - up to 15 % - when it comes to their parents .
in other parts of the study selected children ( 204 boy and a 172 girl of 13 schools ) were asked to make your own menu of proposed products , and based on their tastes and preferences .
their favorite food includes a large number of flour , meat and sweet dishes .
as the main dinner dishes паста bird won with a slight margin .
" many participants of the control group study showed a significant shift of the healthy food , when the questionnaire after lectures obesity is not a coincidence , " according to the results of the project .
in addition , as the main dishes children often noted poultry and fish , limiting the number of sweet dishes and bake .
in the first article about training for stylists i railed on the amount of information on the introductory classes .
lecture three experts in this area ; advice on clothing for unconventional figures ; and a seminar about how it works in real life .
than the closer you get to a final exam , the more information and practical task awaits us .
at this time with аленкой , director ( on the course no one man ) , we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetric .
one short neck , the other has a boyish figure without proper forms , another weighs more rules .
we were given tips on how to emphasize figure women like jennifer lopez , i.e. , обладательниц more lush chest and hips and narrow waist , and not wearing them too provocatively .
you obviously will not regret the invested funds because ideal сидящая clothes is priceless .
обладательницы мальчишеских figures on the other hand , can wear clothing with рюшами аппликацией , embroidered or folds .
and yet , i 'm afraid it is too much , given a homework assignment , which we received .
we should take into account their modern appearance , their style of clothing and type of figure .
i am happy about myself , because it put much easier than , say , britney spears , christina агилеру , which recently recovered per ton ( please keep in mind that i exaggerate ) , or young селену gomes altogether .
мудборд so - called work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image .
stylist not just dress real people , but creates food pages in magazines ( based on the special guidelines , for example , trendy purses , coat , etc. ) .
saturday lecture , the information about the types of figures , and three guests - specialists .
jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and stylist should use this fact .
another possibility - roll up your sleeves or raise the collar , and the whole image completely changing .
whatever , i most appreciated the following advice : " for your work you should ideally know the rules . "
here i finally understood why we зубрим all definitions and rules that combined with than and why , while in fashion magazines , we often see another .
from ben , a photographer , i learned that stylist наготове should have more options than outfits , the number of photos that he needs to be done .
now , i also know that on the picture piece of clothing that often looks and works in conjunction with other not as in reality .
хонза покорны confirmed that often image and style - half of success .
attitude to услугам stylists in the czech republic - is still fairly cool .
and if someone finally allows us to create their style , we should expect that they call us another ( less ) size , than that they really are .
on sunday хонза and mario did emphasis on that for stylist not enough to deal in fashion and be able to pick up attire .
to to be able to assess people do not condone them and stick to their opinion .
" find at least a few things you can praise , and encourage that can be worn along with them " mario says .
this bag , you повязываете around the waist , to wear all the necessary .
to distract from the lectures and get some practical experience , we have learned the right thing to do , on the soles of shoes .
i understand that being a professional stylist not so easy , whatever .
ambitions were to some extent , but it does not matter because no one is clearly not want to do extra work .
she expected that the previous series need for speed in a new direction ; testified about that game demo versions will take place in racing games .
as often happens with nfs , eventually much different from what we expected .
and , in fact it is not mistakes , and developers manifestation of inexplicable laziness .
you become part of history , the hero , jack , which decides , resolve some personal problems with participation in illegal race across america .
this means that every race passes along his route , separate phases are diverse and interesting environment .
despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series , and that it is pleasant to look at some tracks .
although driving through the desert , on autumn suburbs or high in the snow - capped mountains very nice .
for example , in the desert you are in a sandstorm significantly снижающую visibility .
for a while you 're trying to overtake several rivals ( essentially a normal race ) ; then you 're trying to improve ( standard time race from the секундомером ) ; or you 're up against one opponent .
really , it turns out that for the game is good , because property is not boring ; given all this , this is one of the things that make entertaining .
this means that it no longer represents something special , but this should not be considered a drawback .
and yet this model is driving very suited for dynamic races , while the market you can find more good options .
from this game does not expect complex transformation and clashes , but if you have no idea before a clash with the object , how your machine , something is wrong .
перезапуски designed so that if you or разбиваетесь far uhodite29 off the game returns you to the point where she interrupted .
if you use them all , you 'll have to start race from the outset .
иногда перезапусков not enough , and you have to learn by heart separate section of the race .
for example , some turns to pass a certain way , otherwise you just do n't впишетесь .
this is especially irritating in situations when you see , as your opponent easily rides between the two cars , moving in the opposite direction , whereas when you get , there already are , so that you need to either their povolgie or lose speed .
this is especially evident late in the game , on a long bridge , where you are in the opposite direction .
the thing is that when he was leaving before you , it affects you review , which leads to one or more accidents on this area .
pity , because despite simple driving model game занимательна and sometimes full of events , so that you do n't have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
the main story mode is closely associated with regime challenge mode ; this race to individual sites , you will see during the game .
many opportunities are available for higher level driving data ranging from cars and to profile .
here is another flaw , difficult to understand ; it is an example of the last race in sequence .
your speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( so ) , let 's assume that , back when suddenly you налетает metro train , your car into a pile of scrap metal .
technical element of the games does not constitute anything ; but the overall impression from видеоряда mostly sweet , sometimes even startling .
this applies particularly to accidents involving a large number of participants , where good recording , too , would you do n't particularly helped .
to please the broader youth audience as possible , the soundtrack 'вошли compositions from the different styles of ' ; but it is unlikely many people buy the game because of its music .
if game avoided clearly unnecessary mistakes , we could honestly say that the escape is the best part of the nfs in the last few years .
of course , it 's good fun , but be ready , that defects ослепят you , as прожектора airport .

" we have the schengen zone , enhanced cooperation " and we already have the institute .
" the number of such institutions will grow ; it will be a real two - speed europe " , expects виценова .

may , shopping and is a hobby for most women , but for men it can be a hellhole .
" i need to to lose at least five kilogram -- maybe i should start , do gymnastics ? "
then you enter the group of women , on his appearance .
a strong paul also agrees that more such complaints , the more women their annoying .
you criticize your partner for what it comes to clean tile in squalid boots ; children for dirt in the net sink and fingerprints on window glass in the living room , which was so difficult clean ?
bland pursuit of purity could threaten your relationship , as well as the entire family .

one second before the first break home player patrick двайер reduced the gap with certainty of , but early in the second half led флайерс again .
after jagr effective submission he scored the third goal ; his strike was transformed into the fourth goal in future wayne симмондсом .
" i do n't want to say he 's the best player of the league , but it is the top three best , " jagr said , praising their центрового .
" all these years in the nhl my teammates tried to help me , and now my turn , " jagr added .

голы jets , which had пятиматчевую a series of defeats , have been five different players .
before 1989 , only five state tourist agencies could work in the former czechoslovakia : čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea and autoturist .
thus , czech tourists went on holiday in the german democratic republic of crimea ; the soviet union ( sochi , on the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both countries on the black sea ) ; and hungary ( балатон ) .
it was a great paradox of the socialist period , that citizens socialist bloc ( i.e. , and czechoslovakia ) were not permitted individual trips socialist countries .
at the time travel agencies offered travel to the west , but had to either stand in the queue all night , with the travel bag , or be " good friends " in the agency .
currency permission was needed for trips to the west . his were not politically unreliable people , who do not was allowed to travel .
most czechs held their vacation home that led to a large number of cottages and summer houses , this habit persists to this day .
while the pre - 1989 vacation in the gdr or bulgaria was the culmination of our holiday travel , in last year the czechs have 4.5 million in the countries around the world .
in the early 1990s to obtaining a visa to the neighboring countries of western europe was cancelled . this marked the beginning of a huge wave of short travel mainly in vienna and germany .
for example , in paris , czech tourists slept in tents in parks , as their incomes at the time lacked for the hotel or guesthouse .
another important moment - introduction of a freely convertible czech krona . decades later our tourists finally can freely buy western currency .
since 1997 , the increased demand allowed tourist agencies prepare regular flights , performed чартерными . compared with the past , airlines now incredibly cheap by order wholesale travel discounts .
following significant event in the history of travel after the revolution happened in 2000 . big demand led to the historically first direct чартерному voyage from the czech republic in exotic country , thailand .
november 17 , 2008 , united states abrogated the need for visas for czech travelers . our country , so forever joined the most developed world countries .
йиндржих райхл , miroslav пельта and tomas пацлик жаждут to lead the czech football .
nevertheless , era гашека again plunged football association in strife between the two chambers , who can choose a single candidate .
delegates meeting it came to national house in prague , смихов because negotiations remained blocked off , not only procedure election .
this moment since was partially resolved thanks to the recommendations of the state and law institute , according to which provided representation based on the mandate , it is impossible .
executive board also not helped , although their meetings , both regular and extraordinary , he mostly busy this issue .
the question is : how to move to a 3 - mu round and avoid pat ?
based on the model , under the charter , winner of the 3rd round of the candidate is receiving more support for the house , from which he serves as a candidate .
czech party insists on condition that in the overall percentage winner must gain at least two - thirds majority vote .
several suddenly tomash пацлик agrees with his opinion , although according to election rules , some charter , with more пельту than other candidates .
" i want to avoid всевозможной of stupidity , as the previous meeting , " says the owner of victoria пльзень , who was the first is the candidate ; and in his remarks , he largely contradicts пельте .
he believes that the new president will become a known нимбурке ; he also hopes that future candidates will work constructively .
" football will be on the happy wave again , people will be more willing to cooperate , " said representative яблонеца . from three candidates it has more experience in football management at both the professional and at regional levels .
" i hope the agreement , but the situation very varied . "
not so much time left to the sides reached agreement .
additional flight , which was supposed to , among other things , vice - presidents далибора coachman and райхла подгорицу , flew from prague in the morning due to technical malfunctions . sought an alternative , to deliver part of the executive committee to place переигровочного match .
minister of education , youth affairs and sport , josef добеш , i would like to hand - opponents in the strongest sports association in the country came to agreement .
пацлик enters presidential fight , as he sees no suitable candidates
" if he were a worthy candidate , i would have fought for him and myself did not participate in the struggle . "
motive пацлика to join the fight against miroslav пельтой and йиндржихом райхлом - try to prevent пельте , предположительному фавориту election , to enter management fačr .
in future he would like to see this post has experienced the top - manager , not too associated with football life .
" it was terrible for me to hear how some of them said that at the moment they do n't even want to do with czech football . "
currently the main disagreement пацлика with пельтой connected with the relationship last with novel бербром , president of the regional soccer association in пльзене . бербр - a controversial reputation behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist , can affect voting delegates universal meeting .
" if he wins , the current situation will remain without changes , and football will not move forward . "
he refers to the fact that a few years ago name пельты was recorded during the phone with the investigation of corruption ; пельте was avoided .
" as we would look in the eyes of uefa and fifa , " said пацлик . now he does not mention his previous statement about the fact that he will sell the club пльзень if пельта becomes president . "
this opinion is shared by another candidate райхл пацлик supported before the general assembly in september , закончившимся fiasco .
пацлик argues that he risk management association .
" i have to make football environment change , to support her changes for the better . "
one of his priorities will be to strengthen relationships between fačr and czech olympic committee , with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money on sport of lottery money .
" if taxes on gambling , according to political parties , i understand their arguments , but they should make clear where the funds , " he said .
пельта associated with яблонецем and райхл with prague дуклой .
" and yet i did n't see any point in the club 's hypocritical transfer my shares пльзень someone else , i 'm going back six months , " says пацлик .
for two days before the general meeting of the football association in one of the presidential candidates , miroslav пельта , promised that if elected , he will fight for new rules fačr , to avoid disputes over election rules in the future .
before september пельта проваленных elections promised that if he wins , he focuses both on the representation and on receiving funding .
" people at all levels has long been in football , and they expect the president will be known on thursday . "
this gives him grounds to believe that he enough to manage czech football .
" unfortunately , the rules , which were not so perfect , as we all thought , were taken by the general meeting in june . "
he treated переписыванию key document civil association as a false targets for delegates .
" this fundamental question , without which we ca n't exist , " said пельта .
in the past , he has claimed that he can imagine its cooperation with йиндржихом райхлом , whom he appreciates the legal education ; he is quite aware of the fact that his rival candidate - should be his first vice president .
" he in football more than a year and achieved some success . "
" and therefore some of them now doubting his true identity , " said пельта конкуренте . himself пельта argues that he 's faithful declarations , which announced in september .
" immediately after that i would have on the negotiations with both private and public sectors to ensure enough money for the entire football сорокашестилетний candidate , " said čtk two months ago .
" i will need to learn the individual . " it was his message страхову instructions , where prolonged междувластия causes understandable nervousness .
" if the only controversial question - how to conduct elections in the third round , with this we can cope . "
райхл promises that under his leadership will work actively fačr
райхл promises that if elected , there comes a time of hard work .
he also promises to solve the problem богемцев ; improve relations with both uefa and fifa ; to attract more money in football ; and continue to work the previous president , ivan гашека .
" from the international contacts with uefa and fifa , to the national team , professional soccer and football activities for youth . "
" i am a team player , and i want to distribute power in the executive committee so that each member on a particular area . "
" this is probably wo n't many people because it will mean hard work , rather than simply criticizing the work of others , " he added .
" about me knows that i work 20 hours a day " .
" nevertheless , many people told me that i should not resign , or will other . "
moreover , he said that his motivation to continue to work , which he began with гашеком .
processes that can bring results were launched after a few years , and i do n't want someone else to stop them , " he said , fearing that if another candidate , miroslav пельта , will be elected , the situation in may return to the one that was before гашека association .
" he is surrounded by people who were football , so he was available only for the few " .
moreover , he refutes allegations that he will only be president of czech republic .
" for example , it is time to think about the division of the second league and the czech моравскую parts , which continue to struggle in the first league winners . "
while in the presidential fight into managing club пльзень tomash пацлик , райхл not dare to assess his chances of winning .
on the other hand , he partially blames himself in that there is no unity in the association .
" nobody can doubt that he worked in the this year . "
" he would not distort the facts for their benefits , " said райхл about his opponent .
