" such a strong reduction , so , make most of our projects кораблестроению repressions and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the confidence to those who supports our army and will bring serious damage combat readiness " .

a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how are serious and повсеместны deception and lies in our everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании , because they allegedly hid the that the retired retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial fraud during the campaign , connected with the укрывательством fornication ties .
history about the fraud charges on the exams in school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors who must be to teach the opposite , send a message , that lies and fraud are acceptable .
during the one day , as studies show that , you can lie from 10 before 200 times .
another study showed that the unfamiliar people солгали three times in the first 10 minutes online dating with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
is not worth from this draw the conclusion that liars difficult notice and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interview , negotiation or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about other , usually to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , most often наглая ) .
observe behind the asphyxia that laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , change its position in a certain way , or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complex question completely .
somebody can use the " qualification language " , when responds to a difficult question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical funds , to expose the lie , but to master the skill detection of deception can be .
