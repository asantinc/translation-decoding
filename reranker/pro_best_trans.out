more than one - third of children ranging in age from 9 to 13 years , weigh more norms ; in schoolchildren are overweight , while 9 % 5 % suffer from obesity .
once again , we see the importance of surroundings and behavior models , accompanying person , for his or her healthy development .
more than 19 % of children who suffer from obesity , ate for dinner to french fries on the eve of the survey , of educational event titled obesity is not accidental .
obesity is not a coincidence the event was conducted for the second consecutive year , with support from insurance company všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and sisco .
proper nutrition and enough sports load are the main factors causing rapidly growing number of children who suffer from excess weight or from obesity .
in czech republic of only 23 % families schoolchildren завтракают together .
worse discovery was that in every tenth family people not завтракают at all .
study showed , that the fried food more often is used in the families with children , suffering from obesity .
although more than 40 % of children regularly exercise , this figure is declining more than doubled - up to 15 % - when it comes to about their parents .
in another part of the study selected children ( 204 boy and a 172 girls of 13 schools ) was invited to make your own menu , on the basis of the proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences .
their favorite food includes a number of pastry , meat and sugary dishes .
in as the core lunch dishes pasta defeated bird with a slight margin .
" many participants in the control group studies demonstrated a significant shift preference towards the healthy food , when the application after the completion of the lectures obesity is not a coincidence " , says the results of the project .
in addition to as the primary children often noted the bird and fish dishes , limiting the number of sweet dishes and baking .
in the first article about trainings for stylists i railed at the amount of information on the introductory classes .
lectures three experts in this area ; tips on choosing a clothes for standard shapes ; and a seminar about how it all works in real life .
than closer to a final exam , the more we information and practical tasks awaits us .
at this time with аленкой , director ( on the course there is no one man ) we discussed , how to dress a woman , whose body is not perfectly symmetric .
have one a short neck , another has boyish figure without proper forms another weighs more than norms .
they gave us tips on how to emphasize the figure women such as jennifer lopez , , i.e. обладательниц more lush chest and hips and narrow waist , and not to wear them too provocatively .
you clearly will not regret about invested media , as ideal сидящая clothing is invaluable .
обладательницы мальчишеских figures , on the other hand , can wear the clothes with the рюшами аппликацией , embroidery or plaits .
and all the same , i am afraid it is too much , given the homework , that we have received .
we should take into account their modern appearance , their style in clothes and type of the figures .
i am happy about myself , because her dress is easier than , say , britney spears , christina агилеру , which recently recovered per ton ( please , keep in mind that i exaggerate ) , or young селену gomez altogether .
мудборд -- so called the result of the work - then reflects the our own style and attitude to the graphic image .
stylist not just dress real people , but creates food pages in magazines ( based on the special guidelines , for example , trendy purses , coat , etc. ) .
saturday lecture , the information about the types of of shapes , and three guests - specialists in this field .
yakub reminded us , that fashion - this is an illusion and stylist must have to use this fact .
another possibility - roll up your sleeves or to raise the collar , and the entire image of the fully is changing .
as whatsoever , i most appreciated the next council : " for your work you need to ideally know the rules . "
here i finally realized , why we зубрим all definitions and rules that combine with what and why , then as we often see in the fashion magazines is quite another .
from ben , a photographer , i learned that a stylist ready should have more options outfits , than the number of photos , which he need to do .
now , i also know that on the picture subject clothes often looks and works in conjunction with the other not so , like in reality .
honza покорны confirmed that he often image and style - half of all success .
attitude to услугам stylists in the czech republic - is still fairly cool .
and if someone finally allows us to create their style , we must expect that they labeled us another ( less ) size , than that which they really are .
in the sunday honza and mario did the emphasis on that , for the stylist is not enough to deal in fashion and be able to pick up outfit .
in order to be able to evaluate the people , do not condone them and adhere to their opinions .
" locate at least a few things , which you can praise , and encourage that can be worn along with them , " says mario .
this tote bag , which you повязываете around the waist , to wear everything necessary .
in order to distract from the lectures and get some practical experience , we have learned properly to do overlays on the soles of shoes .
i begin to understand that to be a professional stylist is not so easy , no matter what talked .
ambitions to a certain extent have been satisfied , but it does not matter because no one is obviously not want to do extra work .
it was expected that she 's the previous series need for speed in a new direction ; demonstration version testified about that game will take place in the racing genre games .
as often happens with the nfs , ultimately much differs from that what we expected .
and this means that , in reality , this is not errors , and developers manifestation of unfathomable laziness .
you become part of the history , whose protagonist , jack , decides to solve some personal problems with the help of participation in the illicit race across america .
this means that every race passes through to his route , individual stages take place in the diverse and interesting environment .
despite the fact that graphics is located at the same level as in previous parts of the series , and that it is pleasant to look at some tracks .
although driving through desert , on the autumn suburbs or high in the snow - capped mountains very pleasant .
in the desert , for example , you will find yourself in a storm , sandstorm significantly снижающую visibility .
for some time you are trying to overtake several rivals ( essentially a normal race ) ; then you are trying to improve the time ( standard race with секундомером ) ; or with you against one opponent .
actually it turns out that for the game is good , because property is not boring ; given all the foregoing , this is one of the things that make game entertaining .
does this mean , that she was no longer represents something special , but it cannot be considered as a drawback .
and this model driving very suitable for all the same dynamic races , while on the market you can find some more good options .
from such games do not expect difficult transformations and clashes , but if you have no idea before a clash with the object , how your machine , something not so .
перезапуски designed so that if you разбиваетесь far or leave with the track , game returns you on the point , where she interrupted .
if you 're using all of them , you have to to start race from the outset .
sometimes перезапусков not enough and you have to learn memorized a separate plot race .
for example , some twists need pass a certain way , otherwise you just did n't впишетесь .
this is especially annoying in situations when you see how your opponent easily rides between the two machines , moving in the opposite direction , while when you get there , the machines already are located , so that you need to either their povolgie or lose speed .
this is especially evident in the late games , on a long bridge , where are you driving into the opposite direction .
the thing is that when he rides in front of you , he affects you review that leads to one or more of the accidents at this area .
pity , because despite the simple model driving , the game занимательна and sometimes so full of events , that you have no time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
the main story mode is closely connected with the regime challenge mode ; it is a race of individual sites that you learn as the game progresses .
many opportunities are available for receiving more high - level driving data ranging from cars and to profile .
here is another lack of , difficult to understand ; this example from last race in the sequence .
your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( , let 's assume that both ) , when suddenly you behind the onrushing freight train , subway turning your car in a pile of scrap metal .
technical component of the game does not represent a anything ; but the overall impression from the pleasant sequences for the most part , sometimes even startling .
this applies particularly to accidents involving a large number of participants , where good recording , too , would you do n't particularly helped .
to please as can be a broader youth audience , in the soundtrack 'вошли compositions from the different styles ' ; but hardly a lot of people buy the game due to her music .
if game avoided clearly unnecessary mistakes , we could genuinely say that the escape - the best part of the nfs over the past few years .
of course , this is good entertainment , but be ready , that the shortcomings ослепят you , as the floodlights airport .

" take five or six years , before the situation somehow stabilized , down and all the players used to their new roles " , eu ambassador milena виценова rigidly began its lecture at the faculty of law .
moreover , it is виценова praised the work of the new permanent chairman of the of the european council , herman van rompuy :
" he 's a man who can listen to simultaneously twenty seven member countries , to communicate well with them and who has a clear idea of what the eu side will need to develop . "
she said that the government 's resignation in the time was negative phenomena , нанесшим mightily damage to the czech republic .
as ambassador , and said the chairmanship , and the subsequent financial crisis have triggered a continuing in the present time fermentation .
will the budget lean and efficient , what areas will give preference ; which country will receive more support , and what are less ; all these questions - in the upcoming program .
i really do not like " reduction , the foreign words and jargon , which nobody understands .
she also intends to more effectively to use the setting the eu and attract more czechs in the european organization .
ambassador , argues that the czechs believe euro - skeptics ; as well as humans , отмечающими likely negative , not the positive side of things .
she believes that in this blame several factors : modesty , for example , our candidates and their inability to write the motivational letters ; simultaneously with little support with czech side .
" believe me that when i meet someone from poland and hungary , and we the slovak , frenchman next to me and says : " hey , what about the meeting , again visegrad group ? ' and he drops not happy about it . '
compared with a new european federation she believes the idea of двухскоростной , if you do n't multispeed europe 's more realistic .
" we have there is a zone schengen area , and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation . "
" number of such institutions will be grow ; it will be truly two - speed europe " , expects виценова .
if someone wants to find the word that best expresses imb strategy , the closest , will probably be " долговечная . "
durability of the company was laid out its first boss , мечтателем . thomas j. watson - senior .
his slogan " think ! " thus became a stamp , which unfolded around future giant ( and also the title of his domestic life magazine , which imb began to publish in 1935 ) .
" for us , in ibm , long - term thinking means continual movement towards future .
for our first one hundred years this has enabled us to transform the technology that business and company .
dovetails with anti - discriminatory strategy and the current plan , in accordance with which the woman , virginia рометти , will replace palmisano in the next year .

" from the outset , from the perspective of the concept of ibm was the organization , rather than the technology company , " said economist professor at harvard business school and author books about ibm розабет moss кантер .
as they say in the company itself , there is a difference between those , to exit on the market and build it .
it seems that it is the most universal technology the company - formulating hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting and consulting services - from the servers to nanotechnology .
its inventions include , for example , atm , banking map , the financial swap , barcode and floppy disk .
" if your business is defined movement forward , you can not be emotionally tied to the past , ' says samuel j. palmisano .
this it differs , for example , from its rival microsoft , which is based and is experiencing a decline on windows , its operating system .
basic income ibm receives from services , approximately one - fifth in each case comes from computer programs and the hardware .
since 2000 ibm sold низкоприбыльные . assets valued at $ 15 billion in the same time she has invested $ 58 billion in buying promising technologies .
ibm should be example of his first director , thomas j. watson , which has increased the number of investment in years of the great depression .
since the beginning of 2008 the price of shares of ibm rose record 120 percent ; net earnings of the company constantly grew .
so you can expect that even if another crisis , this flexible erupts giant справится with the situation .
international business machines ( ibm ) was founded in new york for a hundred years ago . her original name of " the corporation computation , tabs , recording , " was quite difficult .
future ibm foundations were laid merger four companies , the story which begins in 1880 's - .

then head of the founder of the ibm in the shadow of a - ideas watson remain basis unchanged corporate culture and individuality .
ibm , as it is clear of the names beginning with the production and sale of various equipment for business -- from cheese knives and мясорезок to pos devices .
watson became so important for companies that nearly forty years later his place in the armchair director , took his son , thomas watson jr. .
in the 1960s , " both staff and computers ibm helped nasa control space flights - at the mercury , saturn , and 1969 , the flight of a human on the moon .
classic pc , which defined the computer the standards of the time , under the name of the ibm 5150 , appeared on the market in the 1981 .

" i need to lose , at least five kilogram of - may , i begin to do gymnastics ? "
then you enter into a group of women 's , gearheads on her appearance .
strong floor also agrees with that more such complaints arise , the more women irked them .
you criticize your partner for what he comes on the net tile in the dirty boots ; children for the dirt in the clean sink and fingerprints on the window glass in the living room , which was so difficult clean ?
inoffensive yearning for purity could threaten your relations , as well as across the family .
" wet towels for pottery should not lie on the the floor , " .

after the match jagr said foreign journalists , that he predicted that lean a magnificent evening .
a bit later on the second goal of the team also had " czech trail of " .
for the second before the first break home player patrick двайер has narrowed the gap when shorthanded advantage , but at the beginning of the second half led флайерс again .
after the effective filing he jagr scored the third goal ; in the further his strike was transformed into the fourth goal wayne симмондсом .
" i do n't want to say that he is the best player in league , but he is included in the three best exactly , " said jagr , praising his центрового .
" all these years of my teammates in the nhl tried to to help , and now it 's my turn me , " jagr added .

more than lost sunglasses , home head coach was disappointed a large number of injuries in the back row , because the match ended only with five defenders .
" we 're finished the match with only one an experienced player , the rest were young people " .

goals jets , who ceased пятиматчевую a series of defeats , were clogged five different players .
until 1989 , the only five state tourist agencies could work in the former czechoslovakia : čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea autoturist and .
thus , on vacation czech tourists rode in the german democratic republic of crimea ; soviet union ( sochi , on the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both countries on the black sea ) ; and hungary ( balaton ) .
great paradox of the socialist period was the fact that citizens socialist bloc ( i.e. and czechoslovakia ) were not permitted individual trip to the socialist countries .
while in the travel agencies offered travel on the west , but it was necessary or stand in the queue all night , with travel bag , or have " good friends " in the agency .
currency permission was necessary for the trips to the west . his were not politically unreliable people who generally were not permitted to travel .
most of the czechs held their vacation home , that led to the emergence of a large number of cottages and summer houses , this habit persists to this day .
while pre - 1989 vacation in the gdr or bulgaria was the culmination of our holiday travel , in the past year , czechs spent 4.5 million in the countries around the world .
early in the 1990 , the need to obtain visas in the neighboring countries of western europe was cancelled . this marked the beginning of a huge wave of short travel mainly in vienna and germany .
for example , in paris , the czech tourists slept in the parks in tents , as their income at the time lacked on the hotel or guesthouse .
another important moment - introduction of a freely convertible czech krona . decades later our tourists finally can freely buy western currency .
since 1997 , the increased demand allowed tourist agencies to prepare regular flights , performed чартерными airlines . compared to last , air travel now incredibly cheap thanks to the opportunity to order wholesale discounts .
the next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution happened in the year 2000 . a big demand has led to the historically first direct чартерному voyage from the czech republic in the exotic country , thailand .
17 november 2008 , united states abrogated the necessity to obtain visas for czech tourists . our country , so forever acceded to the world 's most developed countries .
йиндржих райхл , tomas пацлик miroslav пельта and yearn for spearhead czech football .
nevertheless , era гашека again plunged football in the strife between the two chambers of association , which could not choose a single candidate .
delegates of the general meeting of the waste came in the national house in prague , смихов , because the negotiations remained blocked off , not only election procedure .
this moment since then , was partially resolved thanks to the recommendations of the institute of state and law , according to which provided representation based on the credentials , it is impossible .
the executive board , also not too helped , although on their meetings , both regular and extraordinary , he mostly busy this question .
question is in the next : how to move to 3 - mu round and avoid pat ?
based on models , under the charter , the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate , received more support for the chamber , from which he acts as a candidate .
czech party insists on condition that in general percentage winner should score at least two thirds of the votes .
several suddenly tomas пацлик agrees with his opinion , although according to estimates by the election rules , certain charter , with пельту more than other candidates .
" i want to avoid всевозможной представительской stupidity , as the previous meeting , " says the owner of victoria pilsen , who is the candidate ; and for the first time in his remarks , he largely contradicts пельте .
he believes that a new president will be known in the нимбурке ; he also hopes that candidates will be constructively cooperate in the future .
" football will be on the happy wave again , people will be more willing to cooperate , " says representative яблонеца . from the three candidates it has the most experience in football management at both the professional and on regional levels .
" i hope the an agreement , but situation very неоднозначная . "
not so many time left on that , to the sides reached the agreement .
additional flight , which was supposed to , among other things , vice - presidents далибора coachman and райхла подгорицу , not flew from prague in the morning due to technical malfunctions . sought an alternative , to deliver part of the executive committee to a place переигровочного match .
minister of education , youth affairs and sport , josef добеш , i would like to hand - opponents in the strongest sports association in the country came to agreement .
пацлик enters into presidential struggle , because he sees not a suitable candidate
" if it was a worthy candidate , i would have fought for him and himself did not participate in the struggle . "
motive пацлика for entry in the fight against miroslav пельтой and йиндржихом райхлом - try to prevent пельте , предположительному contender election , to enter in the management fačr .
in the future he would have wanted to , to this post was experienced top - manager , not too associated with football lives .
" it was horrible for me to hear how some of them said that at the moment they do not even want to have attitude toward the czech football . "
currently , the main controversy пацлика with пельтой connected with the relationship last with novel бербром , president of the regional soccer association in пльзене . бербр - controversial reputation , a man who behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist , can affect the vote delegates of the general assembly .
" if he wins , the current situation would remain without changes , and football will not be to move forward " .
he hints at the fact that a few years ago пельты name was taped during the listening to phones with the investigation of corruption ; пельте managed to avoid sentencing .
" and as we would have looked in the eyes of uefa and fifa , " said пацлик . now he never mentions his previous statement about the fact that he " sells club pilsen , if пельта will become president . "
this opinion divides the other candidate , райхл , whom пацлик supported before the general assembly in september , ceausescus fiasco .
пацлик contends , that the he risk manage by the association .
" i have strength , to make football wednesday change , to support her changes to the better . "
one of his priorities will be strengthening the relationship between the fačr and czech olympic committee , with whose help he would lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money on sport from lottery charges .
" if taxes are subject to gambling , according to the political party , i understand their arguments , but they must clearly state , where money will go , " he said .
пельта connected with the яблонецем , but райхл with the the prague дуклой .
" and yet i do n't see the point in the club 's hypocritical to transfer my stake pilsen to someone else , once i 'm going to return to six months , " says пацлик .
for two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the presidential candidates , miroslav пельта promised that if his pick , he will fight for the new rules fačr , in order to avoid disputes over election rules in the future .
before проваленных elections in september пельта promised that if he wins , he focuses both on representation , and on obtaining financial resources .
" people at all levels already long in football , and they expect that the president would become known on thursday . "
this gives him grounds to assume that he experienced enough , in order to manage the czech football .
" unfortunately , the rules , which were not so perfect , as we all thought , were accepted at the annual general meeting of in june . "
he treated переписыванию a key document civil association as to false target for delegates .
" it is the fundamental question , without whom we ca n't exist " , argues пельта .
in the past , he has claimed that he can submit their cooperation with йиндржихом райхлом , whom he appreciates for legal education ; he is quite aware of the fact that his candidate - rival must become his first vice - president .
" he had in soccer more than a year and achieved a certain type of success " .
" and that 's why some of them now more doubt in his true identity , " said пельта about his конкуренте . himself пельта argues that he 's faithful declarations , who announced in september .
" immediately after this i would have on the negotiations with both private and public sectors , to ensure a sufficient amount of money for the whole of football , " сорокашестилетний candidate said čtk two months ago .
" i will need to know officials instructions individual employees . " it was his message страхову , where the long period of междувластия creates understandable nervousness .
" if the only contentious question - how to conduct elections in the third round , with this we can cope " .
райхл promises , that when his manual fačr starts work actively
райхл promises that if he is elected , he comes the time heavy work .
he also promises to solve the problem богемцев ; improve relationships with both the uefa and fifa ; to attract more money in football ; and continue to work the previous president , ivan гашека .
" from the international contacts with uefa and fifa , before the national team , professional soccer and football activities for youth " .
" i am a team player , and i want to distribute authority on the executive board , so that each member сфокусировался on a particular area . "
" this is probably do n't like many people , because this will mean hard work , and not just criticism of the work of others , " , he added .
" about me it is known that i work 20 hours per day of the " .
" nevertheless , many people told me , that i should not surrender , otherwise come other " .
moreover , he says , that his motivation - continue to work , which he began with the гашеком .
" were started processes that can bring results through a few years , and i do n't want someone to another stopped them , " he said , fearing that if another candidate , miroslav пельта , will be elected , the situation in the association can go back to the one that was before гашека .
" he is surrounded by people who were would football , so that he was available only for a chosen few . "
moreover , he refutes the charges in that he will only president the czech republic .
" for example , it is time to think about division of the second league winners on the czech and моравскую part of which continued to struggle in the first league . "
while in the presidential fight entered into managing club пльзень tomas пацлик , райхл not dare to assess his chances of victory .
on the other hand , he partially blames himself in is that in the association of is no unity .
" nobody can doubt in that , he worked well in пльзене in this year . "
" he would not distort the facts for his benefits , " said райхл about his or her opponent .
