a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how much are serious and повсеместны deception and lies in the everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged with in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they are allegedly hide that retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was indicted in the financial machinations during the campaign , connected укрывательством extramarital affairs " .
stories about the fraud charges on exams in high school and college - standard affair .
mentors , which should teach the opposite , send the message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
during the one day , as studies show that , you can lie from 10 before 200 times .
another study showed that people unfamiliar солгали three times for the first 10 minutes with each other dating .
unlike in the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , revealing lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
not worth it from doing this conclusion , that liars hard notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiation or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie , which they say , most often наглая . )
observe behind the asphyxia , the laughter , voice characteristics in your facility .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the doors , bend towards the exit , change its position in a certain way , or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with this woman ... completely miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question .
someone who can use the " qualification language , " when answering a difficult question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know " .
