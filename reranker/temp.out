stylists i complained to the first article about the training of the information on introductory classes .
lecture three experts in the field ; advice on clothes for unusual shapes ; and a seminar about how it works in real life .
the closer we final exam , the more information and practical tasks ahead of us .
at this time with аленкой , director ( on the course , no one man we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetric .
a short neck , another has a boyish figure without proper form , another weighs more .
we were given tips on how to highlight figure women like jennifer lopez , i.e. , more lush обладательниц chest and hips and narrow waist , and not to dress too provocatively .
you clearly do n't regret the invested funds as ideal сидящая clothing is priceless .
обладательницы мальчишеских figures on the other hand , can wear clothing with рюшами аппликацией , embroidered or folds .
still , fear , it 's too much , given a homework assignment , which we received .
we should take their current appearance , their style of clothes and figures .
i am happy with yourself , because her dress is easier than , say , britney spears , christina агилеру , which recently recovered per ton ( please keep in mind that i exaggerate , or very young селену gomez .
мудборд so - called work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image .
stylist not just the real people , but creates food pages in magazines ( based on specific guidance , for example , hip bags , coats , etc. ) .
saturday lecture about the types of figures , and three guests specialists in the field .
якуб reminded us that fashion is an illusion and stylist must use fact .
another possibility , roll up sleeves or raise collar , and the image completely changed .
anyway , i appreciate the following advice : " most for your work you should ideally know the rules . "
i finally realized why we зубрим all definitions and rules that combined with what and why , then as we often see in fashion magazines .
from ben , a photographer , i learned that стилиста ready should have more options than outfits , the number of photos that he needs to be done .
i also know that the image of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with other not so , as in reality .
хонза покорны confirmed that often image and style - half of success .
towards services stylists in the czech republic is still pretty cool .
and if someone finally allows us to create their style , we should expect that they call us another ( less ) than the amount that they really are .
sunday хонза and mario emphasis on that for the stylist did enough to be in fashion and be able to outfit .
to be able to see people who do n't condone it and stick to their opinion .
" find at least a few things that you can praise , and encourage that can carry with them , " says mario .
this bag , you повязываете around the waist to wear all the necessary .
to distract from the lessons and get some experience , we have learned to do , the soles of shoes .
i understand that being a professional stylist not so easy , whatever .
ambitions were to some extent , but it does not matter because no one does not want to do extra work .
she expected that the previous series need for speed in the new direction ; demo versions of that game will take place in racing games .
as often happens with nfs , in a much different from what we expected .
and , in fact it is not mistakes , and developers of inexplicable laziness .
you become part of history , whose protagonist jack , decides to some personal problems with participating in illegal race across america .
this means that every race is on his route , separate phases are diverse and interesting environment .
despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series , and that it is pleasant to look at some tracks .
while driving through the desert , for autumn suburbs or in the snow - capped mountains , very nice .
in the desert , for example , you are in a sandstorm significantly снижающую visibility .
for a while you 're trying to pass a few rivals ( essentially a race ) ; then you try to improve the standard race with секундомером ) ; or you 're up against one opponent .
in fact , it turns out that game is good because the property is not boring ; given all this , it is one of the things that make entertaining .
this means it no longer represents something special , but it cannot be a drawback .
and yet this model is driving very suited for dynamic races , while the market could find better options .
from this game does not expect complex transformation and clashes , but if you are not a clash with the object , how your car , something not so .
перезапуски designed so that if you leave or разбиваетесь far off the game returns you to the point where she broke off .
if you use them all , you have to start the race from the outset .
sometimes перезапусков under a separate section of race , and you need to learn by heart .
for example , some turn to be a certain way , because you do n't впишетесь .
this is especially annoying in situations when you see how your opponent easy rides between the two cars , moving in the opposite direction , whereas when you are , there are already , so that you need to either their povolgie or lose speed .
this is especially evident in late games , on a bridge , where you 're in the opposite direction .
in fact , when he goes to you , it affects you review leads to one or several accidents on this land .
pity , because despite the simple model driving game занимательна and sometimes so full of events that you do n't have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
the main story mode closely associated with the challenge mode ; this race to individual sites , you will see during the game .
many opportunities are available for higher level of driving data ranging from cars to profile .
here is another downside , difficult to understand ; it 's an example of the race in succession .
your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( so ) we think that , when suddenly налетает metro train back on you , your car into a pile of scrap metal .
technical element of the games does not constitute anything ; but the overall impression from видеоряда mostly sweet , sometimes even startling .
this is especially accident with a large number of participants , where a record you do not have helped , too .
broader youth audience as possible to please , soundtrack 'вошли compositions from the different styles ' ; but is unlikely many people buy game because of its music .
if the game has clearly unnecessary errors , we could honestly say that escape is the best part of the nfs in recent years .
of course , it 's good fun , but be ready , that defects ослепят you , as прожектора airport .

" we have the schengen zone , and we already have the enhanced cooperation . "
" the number of such institutions will grow ; it will be a real two - speed europe " , expects виценова .

may , shopping and is a hobby for most women , but for men it can be a hellhole .
" i have to at least five kilograms , maybe i start to do gymnastics ? "
when you walk into a group of women , on their appearance .
a strong floor also agrees that more such complaints , more women are annoying .
you criticize your partner for what it comes to clean tile in dirty boots ; children in the dirt clean sink and fingerprints on the window glass in the living room , which was so difficult to clean ?

until 1989 , only five state tourist agencies could work in former czechoslovakia : čedok sporturist , ckm , rekrea autoturist .
thus , czech tourists went on holiday in the german democratic republic of crimea ; the soviet union ( sochi , on the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both countries on the black sea ) ; and hungary ( балатон ) .
it was a great paradox of the socialist period , that socialist bloc citizens ( and czechoslovakia ) were not allowed individual tour of the socialist countries .
at the time travel agencies offered travel to the west , but had to either stand in the queue all night , with travel bag , or a " friends " in the agency .
currency needed permission to travel to the west . him were not politically unreliable people who do n't have been allowed to travel .
most czechs held their vacation home that led to a large number of houses and summer houses , this habit persists to this day .
while the pre - 1989 vacation in germany or bulgaria was the culmination of our holiday travel , the czechs had 4.5 million last year in countries around the world .
in the early 1990s to obtain visas in the neighboring countries of western europe was cancelled . this is the beginning of a huge wave of short journeys in vienna and germany .
for example , in paris , the czech tourists slept in tents in parks , as their incomes at the time , lacked a hotel or guesthouse .
other important point is that a freely convertible czech crowns decades later our tourists finally can freely buy western currency .
since 1997 , the increased demand for tourist agencies prepare regular flights to the чартерными . compared with the past , airlines now incredibly cheap due to the opportunity to travel wholesale discounts .
the next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution happened in 2000 . historically high demand led to the first direct чартерному voyage from the czech republic in exotic country thailand .
november 17 , 2008 , us have to obtain visas for czech visitors . our country , so never joined the world 's most developed countries .
йиндржих райхл , miroslav пельта and tomas пацлик жаждут to lead the czech football .
however , the era гашека again plunged football association in the fighting between the two chambers , who can choose the candidate .
delegates meeting that came to national house in prague , смихов because negotiations remain blocked off , not just the election .
this moment since then , was partially settled with the recommendation of state , and the right to representation , based on the power , it is impossible .
the executive board is also not helped , although their meetings , both regular and extraordinary , he mostly busy this issue .
the question is : how to move to 3 - the round and avoid пата ? "
based on models under the statute , the winner of the 3rd round of the candidate is receiving more support for the house , from which he is the candidate .
czech side insists on condition that the overall percentage must collect at least two - thirds vote .
several suddenly tomash пацлик agrees with his opinion , although according to election rules , some charter , with more пельту than other candidates .
" i want to avoid всевозможной of stupidity , as the previous meeting , " says the owner of victoria пльзень , who was the first is the candidate ; and in his remarks , he largely contradicts пельте .
he believes that a new president will be known in нимбурке ; he also hopes that future candidates will work constructively .
" football will be on the happy wave again , people will be more willing to cooperate , " said representative яблонеца . from all three candidates have more experience in football management at both the professional and regional levels .
" i hope the agreement , but the situation is very divided . "
not so much time left to the sides reached an agreement .
additional flight , which was supposed to , among other things , vice - presidents далибора coachman and райхла подгорицу , flew from prague in the morning because of technical malfunctions . sought an alternative , to get part of the executive committee to переигровочного match .
the minister of education , youth and sports , josef добеш , would like to hand - opponents of the most powerful sports association agreed in the country .
пацлик into presidential battle , because he sees no suitable candidate
" if it was a candidate , i would have fought for him and he did not participate in the fight . "
motive пацлика to join the fight against miroslav пельтой and йиндржихом райхлом - try to prevent пельте предположительному contender , managing fačr elections .
in the future he would like to see this post has experienced senior manager , not too connected with football .
" it was terrible for me to hear some of them said at the moment they do n't want to do with czech football . "
currently the main disagreement пацлика with пельтой connected with the relationship with the novel бербром , president of the regional soccer association in пльзене . бербр - a controversial reputation behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist , can affect voting delegates of the general assembly .
" if he wins , the current situation will remain unchanged , and football will not move forward . "
he refers to the fact that a few years ago name пельты was recorded during the phone with the investigation of corruption ; пельте was avoided .
" as we would look in the eyes of uefa and fifa , " said пацлик . now he does not mention his previous statement about the fact that he will sell the club пльзень if пельта becomes president . "
this view is shared by another candidate райхл пацлик supported before the general assembly in september закончившимся fiasco .
пацлик argues that it risk management association .
" i have to make football environment change to back her changes for the better . "
one of his priorities will strengthen the relationship between fačr and czech olympic committee , with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level for more money on the sport of lottery money .
" if taxes on gambling , according to political parties , i understand their arguments , but they should make clear where the funds , " he said .
пельта яблонецем with , but prague дуклой райхл .
" and yet i do n't see the point of hypocritical of my shares of the club пльзень someone else , i 'm going back six months , " says пацлик .
two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the presidential candidates , miroslav пельта , promised that if elected , he will fight for new rules fačr , to avoid disputes over election rules in the future .
before проваленных elections in september пельта promised that if he wins , he focuses on representation and obtaining funding .
" people at all levels has been in football , and they expect the president will be known on thursday . "
this gives him reason to suppose that he is experienced enough to manage the czech football .
" unfortunately , the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were on the annual general meeting in june . "
he treated переписыванию key document civil association as a false targets for delegates .
" this fundamental question , without which we ca n't exist , " said пельта .
in the past , he has claimed that he could imagine its cooperation with йиндржихом райхлом , whom he appreciates the legal education ; he is aware of the fact that his rival candidate - should be his first vice president .
" in football more than a year and he achieved some success . "
" more and so some now doubt his true identity , " said пельта конкуренте . пельта claims that he himself faithful declarations , which announced in september .
" immediately after that i would have on the negotiations with both private and public sectors , to ensure enough money for football , сорокашестилетний candidate čtk said two months ago .
" i will need to learn the instructions of staff . " it was his message страхову , where prolonged междувластия nervousness is understandable .
" if only the question is how to vote in the third round , we can cope . "
райхл promises that under his leadership will work actively fačr
райхл promises that if elected , comes the hard work .
he also promises to solve богемцев ; improve relations with both uefa and fifa , to raise more money in football ; and continue the previous president , ivan гашека .
" international contact from uefa and fifa , national team , professional soccer and football activities for young people . "
" i am a team player , and i want to distribute power on the executive committee so that every member on the field . "
" it probably wo n't many people , because it will mean hard work , not just criticism of other , " he added .
" i know that i work 20 hours a day . "
" however , many people told me that i should n't give up , or other " .
moreover , he said that his motivation to continue to work , which he began with гашеком .
processes that can deliver the results were launched after a few years , and i do n't want someone else to stop them , " he said , fearing that if another candidate , miroslav пельта , will be elected , the situation in the association could return to that was гашека .
" it is surrounded by people who were football , so he was available only for the " .
moreover , he denied accusations that he will be president of the czech republic .
" for example , it is time to think about sharing the league and the czech моравскую winners of which continue to struggle in the league " .
while in the presidential campaign joined the club пльзень tomas пацлик райхл did not dare to assess his chances of victory .
on the other hand , he partially blames himself that the association is unity .
" nobody can doubt that he worked in the this year . "
he would not " misrepresent facts for their benefit , " said райхл about his opponent .
