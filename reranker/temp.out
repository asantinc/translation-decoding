more than one - third of children aged 9 to 13 years , weigh more than rules ; while 5 % 9 % schoolchildren are overweight , suffer from obesity .
we again see the importance of environments and behaviors , related to a man , for his or her healthy development .
more than 19 per cent of children suffer from obesity , ate for dinner , french fries on the eve of the survey of the educational event titled obesity is not a coincidence .
obesity is no accident was the second consecutive year the event , with support from the insurance company of všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and unilever 's .
proper nutrition and enough sports burden are the main factors causing the rapidly growing number of children who are suffering from excessive weight , from obesity .
in the czech republic , only 23 % the families students breakfast together .
the worst opening was that in every tenth family people are not breakfast .
study found that fried food often used in families , with children , suffering from obesity .
but more than 40 percent of children regularly exercise , this figure falls more than doubled - up to 15 % - when it comes to their parents .
in other parts of the study selected children ( 172 204 boy and girls from 13 schools ) were invited to make their own menu , from the proposed products , and based on their tastes and preferences .
their favorite incorporates a large amount of flour , sweet and meat dishes .
as the main lunch dishes paste won birds with a slight majorities .
" many of the control group study showed a significant shift preferences toward a healthy food , when the application after the completion of the lectures obesity is not a coincidence , " says the results of the project .
in addition , as the main dishes children often celebrated bird and fish , limiting the amount of sweet dishes and cooking .
in the first article about training to stylists i complained the volume of information from introductory classes .
lecture three experts in this area ; tips for choosing clothes for non - standard figures ; and seminar on how it all works in real life .
the closer we are to final exam , the more data and practical quest awaits us .
at this time with аленкой , director , ( on the course there is no one man ) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetric .
a short neck , other boyish figure without proper form , another weighs more than normal .
we were given tips on how to emphasize the figure , women such as jennifer lopez , i.e. обладательниц more lush chest and thighs and a narrow waist , and not to dress them too provocatively .
you will not regret the invested funds , because ideal flarb clothing is priceless .
обладательницы мальчишеских figures on the other hand , can wear clothing with the рюшами аппликацией , embroidery or his .
and yet , i am afraid , it 's too much , given a homework assignment , which we got .
we should take into consideration their modern appearance , their style of clothes and type of shapes .
i am happy to myself , because it put much easier than , say , britney spears , christina агилеру , which recently recovered per ton ( please , keep in mind that i exaggerate ) , or young селену gomez altogether .
мудборд -- so called the result of the work - then reflects the our own style and attitude to the graphic image .
stylist not just the real people , but creates the food pages in magazines ( based on the specific guidance , for example , fancy bags , coats , etc. ) .
saturday lecture , the information about the types of figures and three guests - professional in the area .
jakub reminded us is that fashion - this is an illusion and stylist needs to use this fact .
another opportunity - up sleeves or raise collar , and the image of completely changing .
whatever , i most appreciate the next council : " for your job you ideally need to know the rules . "
here i finally understood why we зубрим all definitions and rules that combined with what and why , while in fashion magazines , we often see another .
from ben , a photographer , i learned that stylist ready should be the more options than the number of photos show that he needs to do .
i also know that the image of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with other not so , as in reality .
honza family reiterated that often the image and style - half of the success .
stylists attitude to the services in the czech republic - still quite cool .
and if someone finally allows us to build up their style , we should expect , what they call us to another ( less ) size , than that which they really are .
sunday хонза and mario did focus on that , for stylist not enough to be in the fashion and be able to pick up attire .
in order to be able to assess people who do n't condone them and to their opinion .
" find at least a few things that you can praise , and encourage , that can carry along with them , " says mario .
this bag that you 're повязываете around waist , to wear everything you need .
in order to distract from the lectures and get some practical experience , we have learned correctly do , on the soles of shoes .
i understand that to be a professional stylist do not so easily whatever .
ambitions were satisfied with , but that does n't matter to some extent , because one clearly did not want to do extra work .
she expected , that the previous series need for speed in a new direction ; the demo version of that game will take place in the racing genre games .
as it often the case with the nfs , as a result is much different from what we expected .
and this means that , in fact , it not errors , and developers manifestation of the inexplicable laziness .
you become part of history , where the main character , jack , decides to solve any personal problems with the help of involvement in illegal race across america .
this means that each race takes place along its route , individual milestones in the diverse and interesting environment .
despite the fact that , schedule is the same level as in previous parts of the series , and that it is pleasant to look at some of the route .
although driving through desert , on the autumn suburbs or high in the snow - capped mountains very pleasant .
in the desert , for example , you will find yourself in a sandstorm considerable снижающую appearances .
for some time , you 're trying to overtake several rivals ( essentially a race ) ; then you 're trying to improve time ( standard race with секундомером ) ; or you 're up against one enemy .
actually it turns out that for the game is good , because property is not boring ; given all the foregoing , this is one of the things that make game entertaining .
this means , that it no longer represents something special , but this cannot be inadequate .
and yet this model is driving very for dynamic races , though on the market could find more good options .
from this game does not expect complex transformation and clashes , but if you are n't before a clash with the object , how your car , something that 's not so .
перезапуски designed so that if you or разбиваетесь far leave off the game brings you to the point , where she interrupted .
if you 're using all of them , you must start race with the start .
sometimes перезапусков are a separate section of the race , and you have to learn the heart .
for example , some of the turns to pass a certain way , otherwise you 're just not впишетесь . "
this is especially annoying in situations when you see how your opponent can easily be driven between the two cars , moving in the opposite direction , then as you get there , cars already are , so that you need to either their povolgie or lose speed .
this is especially evident in the late games , on a long bridge , where are you driving into the opposite direction .
in fact , when he goes in front of you , he makes you review resulting in one or several accidents in this area .
pity , because despite the simple model driving game занимательна and sometimes so full of events that you do n't have time to pay attention to things happening around you .
the main story mode closely linked to the regime challenge mode ; this race of individual sites that you 'll learn during the game .
many opportunities available to gain more high - level data driving : ranging from cars and to profile .
here 's another one drawback , difficult to understand ; it 's an example out of the last race in order .
your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( we assume that both ) , when suddenly you behind the onrushing freight train subway system , turning your car in the pile of scrap metal .
technical component of the game is not anything special ; but the overall impression from sequences for the most part , delightful , sometimes even shocking .
this is particularly true for accidents with a large number of parties , where a good record helped , too , would you do n't particularly .
to please as a broader youth audience , soundtrack 'вошли compositions from the different styles of ' ; but it is unlikely many people buy game because of its music .
if game avoided explicitly unnecessary mistakes , we could honestly say that escape is the best part of the nfs over the last few years .
of course , it 's a good entertainment , but be ready , that defects ослепят you , as the floodlights at the airport .

" it will take five or six years before the situation is somehow stabilized , down and all players used to their new roles " , the eu ambassador milena виценова rigidly began a lecture on the faculty of law .
moreover , виценова praised work of a new permanent chairman of european council , herman van rompuy :
" he 's a man who can listen to twenty - seven member countries at the same time , communicate with them , and has a clear idea what the eu side will need to develop . "
she said , that resignation of the government at that time was negative phenomenon , нанесшим considerable damage to the czech republic .
as ambassador , and said the presidency and the ensuing financial crisis caused a continuing currently in fermentation .
will the budget lean and efficient , what areas will give preference ; which countries receive more support and what 's less ; all those questions - in the program .
" i really did not like the reduction , foreign words and jargon that no one else understands .
it is also preparing to better use setting the eu and attract more czechs in european organisation .
ambassador argues that the czechs think euro - skeptics ; as well as humans , отмечающими negative , rather than positive side of things .
she believes that blame several factors : for example , modesty our candidates and their inability to write the motivational messages ; at the same time with little support from the czech side .
" believe , that when i meet someone from poland and hungary , and the slovak , frenchman next to me , says : " hey , what about the meeting , visegrad group again ? ' and he drops not happy about it . '
compared with a new european federation she believes that the two speed , if you do n't multispeed europe more realistic .
" have the schengen zone , and we already have reinforced cooperation . "
" the number of these institutions will continue to grow ; it will be a real two - speed europe , " expect виценова .
if someone wants to find the word , which best expresses strategy imb , the closest , perhaps , will be the " enduring " .
durability was founded by her first boss , мечтателем thomas j. watson of senior .
his slogan " think so ! " has become a stamp , around which life of the future giant ( as well as the title of his internal magazine , which imb began publishing in 1935 . )
" in ibm , the long - term thinking means for us permanent move towards the future .
for our first a hundred years this has enabled us to transform the technology , business , and a company .
consistent with anti - discriminatory strategy and the current plan , in accordance with that woman , virginia рометти will succeed palmisano in next year .
ibm over the past few years the meeting online , brainstorm , in which there are many future innovation .
" from the outset , with ibm 's point of view of the concept was an organization , rather than technology company , " said economist professor at harvard business school , and the author of the ibm розабет moss кантер .
as saying in the company , there is a difference between the , to exit the market and to create it .
it seems that it is the most universal technology company - of hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting and consulting services from servers to nanotechnology .
its inventions include cash , for example , banking map , financial transaction , bar code and floppy .
" if your business is defined movement forward , you can be emotionally tied to the past , ' samuel j. palmisano said .
it is different , for example , from its rival microsoft , which is based on and is on the windows , their operating system .
key ibm gets revenues from services , about one - fifth in each case from hardware and software .
since 2000 , ibm sold низкоприбыльные . assets worth $ 15 billion in the same time it has 58 billion in the purchase of advanced technology .
ibm should be the example of his first director , thomas j. watson , who raised the number of investments in the great depression .
since the beginning of 2008 the price of shares of ibm grew at a record 120 % ; net earnings of the company constantly grew up .
so you expect , that even if another crisis erupts , this flexible giant cope with the situation .
international business machines ( ibm ) was founded in new york a hundred years ago . its original name of " the corporation computation , tabs , record , " it was quite difficult .
ibm 's future foundations were laid by merger of four companies , which begins the 1880 's story .
architect of the new company was the businessman charles ранлет flint , who until 1930 and headed the board of trustees of the company .
then head of the founder of ibm in the shadow - ideas watson remain the basis of secure corporate culture and individuality .
ibm , as it is clear of the names beginning with the production and sale of equipment for business -- from cheese knives and мясорезок to cash - machines .
watson became so important for the company , that almost 40 years his place in an armchair director , took his son , thomas watson jr. .
in the 1960s , both employees and control computers ibm helped nasa space flights on the mercury , saturn , and flying people on the moon in 1969 .
classic pc that defined computer standards of the time , called the ibm 5150 , appeared to be on the market in 1981 .
over the past three years , ibm achieved great success with their concept of the smarter planet .
in the field of commerce , ibm recently announced smarter commerce platform that helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle .
in the former czechoslovakia as the first country , which both in central and eastern europe , ibm funded its office in 1932 .

some women admit that they need control over his passion for шоппингу somehow .
can , shopping and is a hobby for many women , but also for men it can be a hellhole .
" i need to throw as at least five kilograms , maybe i begin to do gymnastics ? "
then you enter a group women , on outside .
a strong floor also agree that the more such complaints , more women are their annoying .
you criticize your partner for what it comes to clean tile in dirty boots ; children for the dirt in the net sink and fingerprints on window glass in the living room , which was as difficult clean ?
inoffensive quest for purity could threaten your relationship , and the family .
" wet towel to utensils should not lie on the floor . "
of course , you have good intentions , you just want , to all it perfect .
women focused on the relationship between , so they like to discuss who , with whom , how and where and why .

naked jets , who cancelled пятиматчевую a series of defeats , had been stuffed with five different players .
before 1989 , just five state travel agencies could work in the former czechoslovakia : čedok sporturist , ckm , rekrea autoturist and .
so , czech tourists went on holiday in the german democratic republic of crimea ; the soviet union ( sochi , on the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both on the black sea ) ; hungary ( zagreb ) .
it was a great paradox of the socialist period that the citizens of the socialist bloc ( i.e. , and czechoslovakia ) have not been permitted individual trips on the socialist countries .
at the time , travel agencies offered travel to the west , but they had to either stand in the queue all night , with a travel bag , or a " good friends in the agency .
currency permit was needed to travel to the west . it were not politically unreliable people , which in general was not allowed to travel .
most czechs spent their vacation at home , which led to a large number of houses and summer houses , this habit remains to this day .
while the pre - 1989 vacation in germany or bulgaria was the culmination of our holiday travel , the czechs conducted a 4.5 million last year in countries around the world .
in the early 1990 the need for a visa in neighbouring countries of western europe was cancelled . this is the beginning of a huge wave of short journeys in vienna and germany .
for example , in paris , the czech tourists slept in parks in tents as their revenues at the time lacked on the hotel or hotel .
another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible czech krona . after decades of our tourists finally can freely buy foreign currency .
since 1997 , the increased demand allowed tourist agencies prepare regular flights , the чартерными . compared with last , airlines now incredibly cheap thanks to the opportunity to travel wholesale discounts .
following a significant event in the history of the travel after the revolution happened in 2000 . a big demand has led to the historically first direct чартерному voyage from the czech republic in exotic country , thailand .
on 17 november 2008 , the united states abrogated the need for a visa for our country , so czech tourists . forever joined the world 's most developed countries .
йиндржих райхл , miroslav tomasz пацлик and пельта crave to lead the czech football .
however , the era гашека again plunged football association in the fighting between the two chambers , who can choose the candidate .
delegates meeting it came in the house in prague , смихов , because the negotiations remained blocked off , not only election procedure .
this moment since was partially settled with the recommendation of the institute of state and law , according to the office , based on the mandate , it is impossible .
executive board also not helped , even though their meetings , both regular and extraordinary , he mostly busy exactly this issue .
the question is how to move to 3 , round and avoid unnecessary pat ?
based on the model , under the charter , the winner of the 3rd round of a candidate received more support for the chamber of commerce , which he is a candidate .
czech side insists that on condition that in the overall percentage winner must gain at least two - thirds of votes .
somewhat unexpectedly tomasz пацлик agrees with his opinion , though the election rules , estimates that some of the charter , with пельту more than the other candidates .
" i want to avoid всевозможной representative stupidity , as the previous meeting , " says the owner of victoria пльзень , who is a candidate ; and for the first time in his remarks , he mostly contradicts пельте .
he believes that the new president will be the known нимбурке ; he also hopes that candidates will constructively cooperate in the future .
" football will be on the happy wave again , people will be more willing to cooperate , " said representative яблонеца . most of the three candidates have more experience in football management at a professional , as well and regional levels .
" i have hope for agreement but the situation really varied . "
left so a lot of time to parties reached an agreement .
an additional flight , which was supposed to , among other things , vice - presidents далибора coachman and райхла подгорицу without flew from prague in the morning due to technical malfunctions . sought an alternative to deliver the part of the executive committee to place переигровочного match .
minister of education , youth affairs and sports , josef добеш , i would like to hand - opponents in the strongest sports association in the country come to agreement .
пацлик comes in the presidential fight , because he sees no suitable candidate ,
" if it was a candidate , i would n't have fought for him , and he participated in the fight . "
motive пацлика for entry into the fight with miroslav пельтой and йиндржихом райхлом - to try to prevent пельте , предположительному fačr contender elections , to enter .
in the future , he would like to to this post has experienced senior manager , not too connected to the football life .
" it was horrible for me to hear how some of them said that at the moment they do n't even want attitude toward the czech football . "
currently , the main controversy пацлика with пельтой connected with the relationship last with roman бербром , president of the regional soccer association in пльзене . бербр - a controversial reputation behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist , can affect the voting delegates general assembly .
" if he would win , the current situation will be without change , football will not move forward . "
he refers to the fact that a few years ago пельты 's name was recorded during the phone with the investigation of corruption ; пельте avoided sentencing .
" and as we would have looked in the eyes of the uefa and fifa , " said пацлик . now he does not mention his previous statement about the fact that he " sell the club if пельта western bohemia , will become president . "
this view is shared another candidate , райхл that пацлик supported before the general assembly in september , the ceausescus .
пацлик asserts , that the it risk manage by the association .
" i have power , to make football environment change support its changes for the better . "
one of his priorities would be strengthening relations between fačr and czech olympic committee , with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level , the more money on the sport from lottery revenues .
" if the taxes on gambling , according to political parties , i understand their arguments , but they should clearly state , go to the money , " he said .
пельта related яблонецем , райхл against prague дуклой .
" and yet i did n't see any point in the hypocritical transfer my stock club pilsen someone else , i am going to return to six months , " says пацлик .
two days before general assembly of the football association , one of the presidential candidates , miroslav пельта , promised that if elected , he will fight for the new rules fačr , to avoid controversy over rules in the future election .
before проваленных september elections пельта promised that if he wins , he focuses both on the representation , and on receiving funding .
" people on all levels has been in football , and they expect that the president would become known thursday . "
it gives him a reason to suppose that it is enough , to control czech football .
" unfortunately , the rules that were not so perfect that as we all thought , were taken at the general meeting in june . "
he treated the rewritten key document civil associations as false target for delegates .
" this is a fundamental question , without whom we ca n't exist " says пельта .
in the past , he has already claimed that he can submit their cooperation with йиндржихом райхлом , whom he appreciates the legal education ; he is aware of the fact that his candidate - rival must be his first vice - president .
he in football " more than a year , and has achieved some success . "
" and therefore some of them now more doubts about his true personality , " said пельта about its конкуренте . himself пельта argues that he 's faithful declarations , which announced in september .
" immediately after that i would have on the negotiations with both private and public sectors to ensure enough money for the entire football сорокашестилетний candidate , " said čtk two months ago .
" i will need to find the instructions of individual employees . " it was his message страхову , where prolonged междувластия evokes understandable nervousness .
" if the only controversial question : how to conduct elections in the third round , we can deal with it . '
райхл promises , that under his leadership fačr will actively to
райхл promises , that if he is elected , will be time for hard work .
he also promises to address the богемцев ; improve relations with both uefa and fifa ; to raise more money in the football ; and continue to work the previous president , ivan гашека .
" from the international contact with uefa and fifa , to the national team , professional soccer and football activities for young people . "
" i 'm a team player and i want to distribute authority on the executive board , so that each member of on a particular region . "
" it is probably wo n't many people , because it will mean hard work and not just criticism of the other , " he added .
" i know , that i am work 20 hours , in the day . "
" nevertheless , many people told me , that i do n't have to give up , otherwise , will come other " .
moreover , he says , that his motivation - to continue that he started with next hasek .
" were launched processes that can bring results within a few years , and i do n't want someone else to stop them , " he said , fearing that if another candidate , miroslav пельта , will be elected the situation in the association can go back to the one that was before гашека .
" he is surrounded by people who were football , so he was available only for the few .
moreover , it refutes accusations , that he will only be president the czech republic .
" for example , it is time to think about sharing the second league on the czech and моравскую part of the winners , which continue to struggle in the first league " .
while in the presidential battle was managing director of club pilsen tomas пацлик , райхл not dare to assess his chances of victory .
on the other hand , it partially blames myself in , that there is no unity in the association .
" nobody can doubt that it worked in the in the this year . "
" he would not distort the facts to his benefit , " said the райхл about his opponent .
