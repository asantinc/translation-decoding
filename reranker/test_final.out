it 's interesting , because i think , there are a few songs on this album , which may seem easier , but there are songs like the end , or just breathe , which are considered very grim , though they may sound a bit positive .
i think that when you grow , and in your life has been some injury and you have lost family member or friend , these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music , and these two songs , of course , reflect this for me .

if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so this is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection on the share of their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production , not forgetting the constantly critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is why germany is one in its decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , is only a few of those who decisively continues his projects .
although germany 's model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind which carbon emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they have no objection in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized in the international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and create many jobs that may not be moved to another industry .
any engineer - electrician will order epr , calculated to work 60 years old , if the planned closure of its maker ?
development of low - carbon solutions by areva , nuclear and renewable energy , testifies взаимодополнимости sources .
in france we have security body that monitors existing , too , and transparent energy centres , such as фламанвиль .

in the chernobyl reactor device and unforgivable human error led to tragedy .

then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) said that " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people who will determine our future , may 2011 , princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
influenced by fears of immigrants based on the view that they can replace the local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking wage declines .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - dynamic sectors , where the training are not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the labor organization , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) , on average , 150 000 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to vote and make it as direct as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become the " tool of suppression , " as when a republican philosopher etienne вашро .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом order .
no , we are dreaming not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty , europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with each of its nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , extricating itself from the markets , and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , had to " create a " republican .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe at the political level , this popular european sovereignty .
in fact , the 2011 completed 11 % sales growth of the world bank cards , mobile phones with chips ( sim - cards ) , above , according to eurosmart , 6 thousand million units .

among debris left after the surgery , french and нигерские , investigators found a few telephone sim card belonging to the terrorists .
analysis of the place calls , has pointed out several находившихся in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but surely , you have to wait for more reliable evidence , before we talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years already , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more intense , " says кунле амуво , a nigeria researcher .
the international community , led by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the challenges posed by boko haram .
it focused mainly on the churches , bars and authorities .
in the last christmas it claimed responsibility for share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then for one more in abuja .
in august , the local office of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when aqmi has in mali and niger , but somalis of al-shabaab are boko haram in kenya , a new threat to the continent .

john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only candidate , the complex foreign policy could not overcome position that потакает emotions .
but huntsman , who has been at the bottom of the ratings , remained неуслышанным .
romney also promised military strikes on iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur херман caine , the second ranking candidates demonstrated the обескураживающее ignorance .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and to the military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use the us army against drug cartels in mexico .
all this is a far cry from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy .
they remind us that obama was himself a lover and that he had to reduce tone about the fight against terror .
after iraq , it does not believe the military intervention , that увязают in the sand .
the north stream , new gates for the entry of russian gas to europe .
he is on the supply of gas equivalent of 30 million households .
more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and government participated in last tuesday on the shores of the baltic sea , between orchestra and exquisite performance snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , a new gas pipeline , which directly links russia and germany under water .

but this seems unlikely that piping designers seams , designed for протечку only once in 100,000 years .
сигароообразный аппарат introduced a 1 - meter diameter pipeline inside and pushed forward the flow of gas .
gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for any repairs .
these five companies created a joint venture , called the northern flow , which has been commissioned to build and operate gas pipeline .
then gazprom gave the company leases the twenty years with the possibility of extension of the entire gas transportation .
natural gas pipeline was financed by 30 % shareholders and 70 % of bank loans .
gas pipeline out of the baltic sea in любмине on the sandy beach , засаженный coniferous trees .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before sucked it in german gas pipelines .
at full capacity it will be 3 million an hour , and 6 million in 2012 .
