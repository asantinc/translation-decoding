given the recent bad experience with the afghanistan and iraq , we decided to reject the military occupation of libya .
though without the occupation will oil companies , libya 's black gold almost for cheap ?

both countries also have data on the second quarter , in which germany has things were going better than expected ( growth of 0.3 % instead of the original 0.1 % ) . france reported a small decrease , 0.1 % ( the original information would stagnation ) .

czech team was lucky to maintain a significant advantage in the second half after the home of the match , and she once again to take part in the european championship .
almost anything remarkable in the first half , and a luck in the second .
an excellent defense czech team allowed the montenegro team to create a dangerous moments only in the second half of game .
a magnificent peter чех is one of the reasons that the czech national team will not miss european championship in the next year . and the czech football thereby chiryurt approximately 200 million czech crowns .
both teams experienced difficulties with the combinations ; the game most of the time came in the center field .

more than one - third of children between the ages of 9 to 13 years weigh more standards ; while 9 % of schoolchildren are overweight , 5 % are obese .
again , we can see the importance of environment and patterns related man , for his or her healthy development .
over 19 % of children suffering from obesity , ate for dinner , french fries on the eve of the survey , of the educational event called obesity is no accident .
event obesity is no accident was the second year in a row , with support from the insurance company všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and unilever .
proper nutrition and sufficient sports load are key factors causing the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from excessive weight or obesity .
in the czech republic , only 23 % of the families schoolchildren breakfast together .
worst discovery was that in each of the tenth family people not to breakfast at all .
research has shown that fried food more frequently is used in the families with children , suffering from obesity .
though more than 40 % of children regularly exercise , this number is down more than doubled - up to 15 % - when it comes to their parents .
in another part of the study selected children ( 204 boy and 172 girls from 13 schools ) was asked to make their own menu of proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences .
their favorite food includes a quantity of flour , meat , and sweet dishes .
as the main lunch dish pasta won birds with little narrow margin .
" many participants of the control group study showed a significant shift of the healthy food , when the questionnaire after lectures obesity is not a coincidence , " according to the results of the project .
in addition , as the main dishes , children often noted the poultry and fish , by limiting the number of sweet meals and baking .
in the first article on training to stylists i said on the amount of information in the introductory classes .
lectures by three experts in the field ; advice on clothes for unusual shapes ; and a seminar on how it works in real life .
closer we to the final exam , the more information and practical tasks we expect .
at this time with аленкой , the director , ( on the course there is not a single man ) we discussed how to dress a woman , whose body is not perfectly symmetric .
one short neck , the other has a boyish figure without proper form , another weighs more standards .
we were given tips on how to emphasize figure women such as jennifer lopez , i.e. , обладательниц more lush chest and hips and narrow waist , and not to dress them too provocatively .
you clearly will not regret about the investment , as perfect clothes is invaluable .
обладательницы мальчишеских figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with рюшами , аппликацией embroidery , or the folds .
and still , i 'm afraid , it is too much , given the homework , that we received .
we must consider their current appearance , their style of clothing and type figure .
i am happy about myself , because its clothing is much easier than , say , britney spears , christina агилеру , who recently recovered per ton ( please , keep in mind that i exaggerate ) , or very young селену gomez .
мудборд - called the result of the work , then reflects our own style and attitude to graphic image .
stylist not just the real people , but creates product pages in journals ( based on specific guidance , for example , trendy purses , coats , etc. ) .
saturday lecture , the information on types of shapes , and three guests specialists in the field .
yakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be to use this fact .
another opportunity to " roll up sleeves or raise the collar , and the entire image changes completely .
however , i most appreciated the following advice : " for your work , you need to ideally know the rules " .
here , i finally understood why we зубрим all definitions and rules that combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see the different .
from ben , the photographer , i learned that a stylist ready should have more options outfits than the number of photographs , which he needs to do .
i also know that in the picture piece of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with other not as well as in reality .
often honza obedient confirmed that image and style - half of the success .
relationship to the services stylists in the czech republic - is still rather cool .
and if someone finally lets us create their style , we should expect , what they call us to another ( less ) size , than that which they really are .
on sunday , honza and mario did focus on that for the stylist is not enough to be a fashion and be able to choose outfit .
to be able to estimate people , not condone them and stick to his opinion .
" find at least a few things you can praise , and encourage that you can wear along with them , " mario says .
it bag that you повязываете around waist to carry all the necessary .
to distract from the lectures and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly to do overlays on the soles of shoes .
i begin to understand that to be a professional stylist is not so easy , no matter what talked .
ambitions to a certain extent have been met , but it does not matter , because no one is clearly not wanted to do extra work .
it was expected that it 's the previous series need for speed in a new direction ; the demo version of testified about that game will take place in the racing game genre .
as often happens with the nfs , in the end much is different from what we expected .
and , in fact , it 's not mistakes , but the manifestation of the inexplicable laziness .
where you become part of history , the main character , jack , decides to solve some personal problems with participating in illegal race across america .
this means that each race takes place along its route , individual stages are in diverse and interesting environment .
despite the fact that schedule is at the same level , that in previous parts of the series , some of the road look nice .
though driving through the desert , on autumn suburbs or high in snow - covered mountains are very nice .
, for example , in the desert , you get in a sandstorm greatly снижающую visibility .
for a while , you are trying to overtake several rivals ( essentially a race ) ; then you try to improve time ( standard race with секундомером ) ; or you 're up against one opponent .
actually , it turns out that for the game it 's good , because property is not boring ; given all this , it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining .
this means that it is no longer represents something special , but it cannot be considered a drawback .
and yet this model is driving very suitable for dynamic racing , although on the market you can find better options .
from this game does not expect the complex transformation and clashes , but if you have no idea before a clash with the object , how your car , something is not so .
перезапуски designed so that if you are разбиваетесь far or leave the track , the game returns you to the point where she is interrupted .
if you use them all , you have to start the race from the beginning .
sometimes перезапусков is not enough and you need to learn the heart of the separate section of the race .
for example , some turns need to a certain way , otherwise you simply do not впишетесь .
this is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your opponent easily rides between the two cars , moving in the opposite direction , whereas when you get there , machines are located , so that you have to either their povolgie or lose speed .
this is especially evident at the end of the game , on a long bridge , where you are in the opposite direction .
the thing is that when he goes in front of you , he affects you review , that leads to one or several accidents in this area .
pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is занимательна and sometimes full of events , so that you do n't have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
the main story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; this race on the individual sites , which you will learn during the game .
many opportunities available for a higher level of driving ranging from cars and ending with data profile .
here is yet another disadvantage , difficult to understand ; this example from the last race in the sequence .
your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( so ) , when suddenly , let 's assume that behind the onrushing freight train subway station , turning your car into a pile of scrap metal .
technical component of the game is nothing special ; but the overall impression from sequences mostly pleasant , sometimes even shocking .
this is especially accidents with a large number of participants , where a good record you would not be especially helped , too .
in order to please as broader youth audience , the soundtrack 'вошли composition of different styles ' ; but it is unlikely many people buy the game because of its music .
if the game avoided clearly unnecessary errors , we could honestly say that the escape is the best part of nfs over the past several years .
of course it is a good entertainment , but be ready , that defects ослепят airport you , as the floodlights .
through the third consecutive year the festival festa academia offers to join the international students and the velvet revolution anniversary day with a musical event .
the main event of the festival is two concerts , which will take place on november 17 .

" it will take five or six years before the situation stabilized , at least a down and all players used to their new roles , " eu ambassador , milena виценова start his lecture at the faculty of law .
moreover , this виценова praised the work of new permanent chair of the european council , herman van rompuy :
" it 's a person who can listen to while twenty - seven member states , to communicate with them and who has a clear idea of what the eu side will need to develop . "
she said the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon , нанесшим a considerable damage to the czech republic .
as the ambassador said , and the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused continuing currently ferment .
will the budget lean and efficient , what areas will give preference ; which countries will get more support , and which less ; all of these questions in the program .
" i really do not like reduction , foreign words , and jargon that nobody understands .
she also wants to better use environment of the eu and attract more czechs in european organizations .
ambassador asserts that the czechs believe the euro - skeptics ; as well as people отмечающими negative , rather than the positive side of things .
she believes that this blame several factors : for example , the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write about motivational letters ; simultaneously with little support from the czech side .
" believe me , that when i meet someone from poland and hungary , and to the slovak , the frenchman next to me says : " hey , what about the meeting , visegrad group again ? ' and he drops not happy about it . '
compared to a new european federation , she finds the idea of two speed , if not the multispeed europe more realistic .
" we have schengen area , and we already have the enhanced cooperation ' .
" the number of such institutions to grow ; it will be a real two - speed europe , " виценова expects .
if someone wanted to find the word that best expresses the imb strategy , the closest , would probably be " enduring " .
durability of the company was inscribed its first boss , thomas j. watson мечтателем senior .
its slogan " think so ! " has become a stamp , around which life future giant ( as well as the title of his internal magazine , which imb started to publish in 1935 ) .
" for us , and ibm , long - term thinking means continuous movement in the future .
for our first hundred years this allowed us to transform the technology , business , and the company .
consistent with the anti - discriminatory strategy and the current plan , in line with which a woman , virginia рометти , will replace palmisano next year .
ibm the meeting in the last few years , online brainstorm , during which there are many future innovations .
" from the beginning , from the perspective of the concept of ibm was the organization , rather than the technology company , " said economist at harvard business school professor and author of the ibm розабет moss кантер .
according to the company itself , there is a difference between , to become a market and create it .
it seems that it is the most universal technology company - formulating hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting and consulting services -- from servers to nanotechnologies .
its inventions include , for example , the atm card , banking , financial swap , bar code and disk .
" if your business is defined by movement forward , you may not emotionally to be tied to the past , ' " says samuel j. palmisano .
it is , for example , its competitor microsoft , which is based , and is falling on windows , its operating system .
main ibm receives revenues from services , about one fifth in each case comes from software and hardware .
since 2000 , ibm sold низкоприбыльные assets valued at $ 15 billion in the same time , it has invested 58 billion purchase of advanced technology .
ibm should suit of its first director , thomas j. watson , who has increased the number of investments during the great depression .
since the beginning of 2008 the price of shares of ibm rose record 120 per cent ; company 's net earnings grew up constantly .
therefore , we can expect that even if another crisis , this flexible giant will handle the situation .
international business machines ( ibm ) was founded in new york , a hundred years ago . its original name " computing , tab , record , " was quite challenging .
future ibm foundations were laid by merger four companies , the history of which starts at the 1880 's .
architect of the new company was a businessman charles ранлет flint , who , until 1930 also headed company 's board of trustees .
then head of the founder of ibm in the shade - idea watson remain the basis of secure corporate culture and identity .
ibm , as it is clear the name suggests , start with the production and sale of equipment for business - from cheese knives and мясорезок to cash .
watson became so important for the company , that almost 40 years later , his place in an armchair director took his son , thomas watson junior .
in the 1960s , both employees and computers , ibm helped nasa control space flights - mercury , saturn , and in 1969 - flying people on the moon .
the classic pc that defined computer standards of the time , called the ibm 5150 , appeared in the market in 1981 .
over the past three years , ibm has made great strides with its smarter planet concept .
in the field of commerce , ibm recently announced smarter commerce platform that helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle .
in the former czechoslovakia , as the first country in both in the central and eastern europe , ibm has funded its branch in 1932 .
headquarters in central and eastern europe in prague , where it is also is a research group , the world - class speeches .

may , shopping and is a hobby for a majority of women , but for men it can become a hellhole . "
" i need to lose at least five - kilogram - can i start doing exercises ? "
then , you enter in the group of women , on its appearance .
strong floor also agrees that the more such complaints , the more women are them annoying .
you criticize your partner , because it comes to clean tile in the dirty boots ; children in the dirt clean sink and fingerprints on window glass in the living room that was so difficult to clean ?
inoffensive quest for purity may threaten your relationships , as well as the the entire family .

women are focused on relationships , so they like to discuss who , where , with whom , and how and why .
in both cases , claude lean used the experience of тридцатидевятилетней star ; he added another transfer and was declared best player of the match .
after the match jagr told foreign journalists lean , because he had predicted a great evening .
a little bit later , the second goal of the team also had " czech scent . "
a second before the first break , a home player patrick двайер narrowed the gap with the certainty of , but at the beginning of the second half and флайерс again .
after the effective for jagr , he scored the third goal ; in the future his strike was transformed into a fourth goal wayne симмондсом .
" i do n't want to say he 's the best player of the league , but he is exactly the three best , " said jagr , praising her центрового .
" all those years in nhl , my teammates tried to help me , and now it 's my turn , " jagr added .

more than those lost points , the home coach was a lot of injuries in the back row , as the match ended with just five defenders .
" we finished the match with just one experienced player , the others were young people . "
" substitution for substitute for , it was astonishing and we could n't resist . "

before 1989 , only five state travel agencies could work in the former czechoslovakia : čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea the autoturist .
thus , on vacation czech tourists rode in the german democratic republic of crimea ; soviet union ( sochi , on the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both countries on the black sea ) ; and hungary ( balaton ) .
it was a great paradox of the socialist period that citizens of the socialist block ( i.e. and czechoslovakia ) were not allowed individual tour of socialist countries .
at the time , travel agencies offered travel to the west , but had to be either stand in the queue all night , with travel bag or have a " good friends " in the agency .
currency permit needed for travel to the west . it were not politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all .
most czechs held their vacation at home , which led to a large number of cottages and summer houses , this habit remains to this day .
in a while before 1989 , bulgaria was the culmination of our travel or vacation in the gdr , last year , the czechs have 4.5 million holidays in countries all over the world .
at the beginning of 1990 , the need for visa in the neighboring western european countries was cancelled . this is the beginning of a huge wave of short trips in vienna and germany .
for example , in paris , czech tourists slept in parks in tents , because their income at the time , lacked the hotel or guesthouse .
another important point is that the introduction of freely convertible czech crowns . decades later our tourists finally can freely to buy western currencies .
since 1997 , the increased demand for travel agencies to prepare regular flights , performed чартерными . compared to the past , air travel now incredibly cheap thanks to the opportunity to order wholesale discounts .
the next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution happened in 2000 . high demand has led to the historically first direct чартерному voyage of the czech republic in the exotic country , thailand .
on november 17 , 2008 , the united states have need for visas for czech tourists . our country , so all joined the world 's most developed countries .
йиндржих райхл , and miroslav пельта tomas пацлик are eager to lead czech football .
however , the era of гашека again plunged football association in fighting between the two chambers , who can choose a single candidate .
delegates of the general meeting that came to the national house in prague , смихов , as negotiations remained blocked off , not just the election .
this moment since was partially resolved thanks to the recommendations of the institute of state and law , according to which representation based on the mandate , it is impossible .
executive board also not helped , though at its meetings , both regular and extraordinary , he mainly engaged in this issue .
the question is : how to move towards 3 - the round and to avoid pat ?
based on the model , under the charter , the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate , received more support from the chamber , where he is the candidate .
czech side insists on the condition that in the general percentage the winner must gain at least two - thirds of the vote .
somewhat unexpectedly tomasz пацлик agrees with his opinion , though the election rules , estimates that some of the charter , with пельту more than the other candidates .
" i want to avoid conceivable of stupidity , as the previous meeting , " says the owner of victoria pilsen , which is a candidate for the first time ; and in his remarks he mostly contradicts пельте .
he believes that the new president will be known in нимбурке ; he also hopes that , in the future , candidates will cooperate constructively .
" football will be on the happy wave again , people will be more willing to cooperate , " says representative яблонеца . of the three candidates , he had more experience in football management at both the professional and at regional levels .
" i hope to an agreement , but the situation is very varied " .
not much time left on to the parties reached agreement .
an extra flight , which was supposed to , among other things , vice - presidents далибора coachman and райхла подгорицу , flew from prague in the morning due to technical malfunctions . sought an alternative to , to deliver part of the executive board to place переигровочного match .
the minister of education , youth and sports , josef добеш , would like to side - opponents of the strongest sports association in the country come to agreement .
пацлик into presidential fight as he does n't see a suitable candidate
" if there was a candidate , i would have fought for him , and itself did not participate in the fight . "
пацлика motive to join the fight against miroslav пельтой and йиндржихом райхлом is to try to prevent пельте , предположительному contender of the elections , enter into management fačr .
in the future , he would like to see this post has an experienced top - manager , not too linked to the football life .
" was terrible for me to hear how some of them said that at the moment , they do n't even want to do with czech football . "
currently , the main controversy пацлика with пельтой connected with the latter 's relationship with roman бербром , president of the regional soccer association in пльзене . бербр - controversial reputation , a man who behind the scenes , known as an influential lobbyist , can affect the delegates of the general assembly .
" if he wins , current situation will be without any changes , and football will not be to move forward . "
he hints at the fact that the name a few years ago пельты was recorded during the phone with the investigation of corruption ; пельте managed to avoid a sentence .
" and how we would look in the eyes of uefa and fifa , " said пацлик . now he does not mention his previous statement about the fact that he " sell the club if пельта pilsen , becomes president . "
this opinion is shared by another candidate , райхл пацлик supported before the general assembly in september , the ceausescus fiasco .
пацлик asserted that , he risk to manage the association .
" i have the strength to make the football environment change , to support it changes to the better . "
one of his priorities would be strengthening the relationship between fačr and czech olympic committee , with whose help he would lobby at the highest political level , the more money on the sports lottery of charges .
" if taxes on gambling , as political parties claim , i understand their arguments , but they must be clear where the money will go , " he said .
пельта is linked to яблонецем and райхл to prague дуклой .
and yet , i do n't see the point in the club 's hypocritical to transfer my shares pilsen to someone else , i am going to return to six months , " says пацлик .
for two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the presidential candidates , miroslav пельта , promised that if elected , he would fight for new rules fačr in the future , to avoid disputes over election rules .
before проваленных election in september , пельта promised that if he wins , he focuses both on the representation and obtaining the funds .
" people at all levels have been in football for a long time , and they expect that president will be known on thursday . "
this gives him reason to believe , that he is experienced enough to manage the czech football .
" unfortunately , the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were taken by the general meeting in june . "
he has rewritten a key document of the civil association as a false targets for the delegates .
" it is a fundamental issue , without which we ca n't exist " , according to пельта .
in the past , he has already claimed that he can submit its cooperation with йиндржихом райхлом , whom he appreciates the legal education ; he is well aware of the fact that his candidate - contender to become his first vice - president .
" he 's in football , more than a year , and achieved some success . "
" and that is why some of them now doubt his true personality , " said пельта конкуренте . itself пельта argues that he 's faithful declarations , which announced in september .
" right after that , i would have on the negotiations with both private and public sectors , to ensure enough money for all the football , " said сорокашестилетний candidate čtk two months ago .
" i will need to learn the instructions of individual employees . " that was his message страхову , where prolonged междувластия causes understandable nervousness .
" if the only controversial question is how to elections in the third round , that we can deal with . "
райхл promises that under its leadership fačr will start actively working
райхл promises that if he is elected , there will be time , hard work " .
he also promised to solve the problem богемцев ; to improve relations with both uefa and fifa ; to raise more money in football ; and continue the work of the previous president ivan гашека .
" from international contacts with uefa and fifa , to the national team , professional football and soccer activities for the young people " .
" i 'm a team player , and i want to distribute authority on the executive board so that each member on a particular area " .
" this is probably not please many people , because it will mean hard work , not just criticism of the work of others , " , he added .
" i know that i work 20 hours a day . "
" however , many people told me that i should n't give up , otherwise others will be " .
moreover , he says that his motivation is to continue the work , that he started with гашеком .
" were the processes that can bring results within a few years , and i do n't want someone else to stop them , " he said , fearing that if the other candidate , miroslav пельта , will be elected , the situation in the association of can return to the one that was before гашека .
" he is surrounded by people who would football so that it was only for elected " .
furthermore , he refutes the allegations that he would be only the president in the czech republic .
" for example , it is time to think about division of the league of the czech and моравскую , winners of which continue to struggle in the first league . "
while in the presidential fight joined the club in pilsen tomasz пацлик , райхл does not dare to assess his chances to win .
on the other hand , he partly blames himself in the fact that in the association , there is unity .
" no one can doubt that he worked in the this year . "
" he would n't distort the facts for their own benefit , " said райхл for his opponent .
