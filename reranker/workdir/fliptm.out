first , your music was more grim , but now it has become a more positive .
it 's interesting , because i think , there are a few songs on this album , which may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end or just breathe , which are considered to be very grim , even though they may be slightly positive .
i think that when you grow , and in your life has been some injury and you 've lost family member or friend , these events are beginning to affect your art and music , and these two songs , of course , reflect this for me .

he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low molecular weight called мальтенами , who , along a road to his typical вязкоупругое .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , changes in the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , specializing in chemical engineering , said .
among the upper layers of bitumen that is made up of little stones опущенных bitumen , and then спрессованных .
the movement of vehicles and latch effort , it helps to be very well on the road coverage .
on асфальтовом covering , he added , is the last layer , called the wear , which is made of small stone , sand and immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , the wear and requires the proper thickness , and must take account of the material , from which he is .

if these figures compare with figures of european neighbors , you can see that french workers , no more inclined to take sick workers than any other country .
the level of fraud linked to sick leave , a very low compared with " grey " employment .
law since 2002 , led to systematic hospital lasting more than 45 days .
in the case of systematically checked hospital sheets for more than 45 days from 1.2 million 11 % of cases were " unreasonable or inappropriate , " that is 132 000 .

germany , in turn , the growth of 0.5 % for the same period .
if there is a theme that the decision which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so that energy policy .
this is a trend , that the electoral meeting place , and are an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their own opinion on the objective facts and the sound .
during the same period will be necessary to complete fossil resources to continue electricity production is growing deficit , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
why germany is one of its decision to abandon a nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil is just a few of those who resolutely keeps his projects .
while the german model , based on the renewable energy , sometimes in as reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives a 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than average in europe .
as the price of energy in a globalized economy is key to competitiveness and the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheaper electricity in europe .
the price that most french people refuse to pay more because they do not oppose this kind of energy in general .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized in international trade in small and medium sized enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry .
one engineer and electrician would order epr , calculated to sixty years , if a planned closure of its maker ?
areva solutions with low - carbon development , the nuclear and renewable energy sources , shows взаимодополнимости .
in france we have the security agency , which is edged and transparent energy centres , such as control фламанвиль .
for 50 years , the nuclear industry has three serious incidents .
in chernobyl reactor and unforgivable mistake led to the tragedy .
the nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , learned from the previous two .
as it is all specialists in energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле they will be a great gift for menacing rivals areva and edf , ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when interior minister ( либерасьон " from france on may 23 , said that " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french economy and immigration for french society .
francois hollande was platitudes in his program , saying that " joint efforts will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of the immigrants based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , especially skilled , provoking declining wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and most skilled , dynamic sectors , where training not related to the proposals .
just as the surgeon would be difficult to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов complementarity between local and immigrants , leads to the arrival of immigrants that positively affects the salaries of local workers .
and without taking into account the fact that this diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates high proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all founded immigrants ) .
according to labor organization , for example , in a german immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus costs an average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth that are used to scare immigrants did precisely the opposite effect .
democracy is fragile and valuable acquisition ; but at the same time .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , a vote and make it as straight as possible .
universal vote , though it is essential to democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a tool of repression " , as republican once philosopher etienne вашро .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing is an economic crisis , but first , it is a political crisis and democracy .
we do n't win , demanding series of national referendums , organized by the need and хаотическом .
on the edge , we dream no guillotine , but the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty in europe , but the entire europe gradually losing its sovereignty , and each of the nations along with it .
because only europeans working together can reduce the weight of debt each , from markets and prepare for future by investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal and jacques all socialists now require european economic government .
but to submit its own without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in граздан , is another madness and a stalemate .
in france to establish a republic , was to " create " republican .
this could only be done by a more democratic europe on the political level , this european sovereignty .
