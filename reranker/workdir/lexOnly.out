mentors , who should teach the opposite , sends a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
within one of the day , as studies show , you may lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that people unfamiliar солгали three times for the first 10 minutes with each other dating .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
not worth it from doing this conclusion , that liars hard notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiation or management .

привирающие people can also use the disengagement in a speech : " i did not have sexual relations with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification " language , when responding to a complex question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... how i know . "
there is no magical funds , to expose the lie , but to master the skill detection of deception can be .

for рольдана , after reaching the shoreline is becoming a " necessary " to discuss the " front toward the mountains , " when a proposal ильдефона серды , gore with green apples , was not done .
модоло , as рольдан and байона with experience in city construction , called the proposal " intellectual challenge " with some of the dangers " .
first fear is a proper restriction of the borders , where one can to build .
" we must think about the new urban planning , because current instruments [ with regard to general capital plan ( gsp ) ] may lead to the real trouble . "
модоло recalls that already has a work made outside the кальсеролы , which " should not miss ailianduo " , although he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project " since the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which asks the name of this part , complex , as in the rules of the contest lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountains , but there are no longitudinal reading , to see and understand the area as a whole . "
on the other hand , a project for some gate may overlap on the program and definition with project architect for the neighboring gate .

рафаель эррера chemical faculty unam , researcher , developed a polymer - modified bitumen , to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable exposed to the environment and temperature .
in his lectures technological view of the pits , read within the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , is developing polymer - modified bitumen for mixed with characteristics close to bitumen production , but with the best resistance , both high and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said specialist in the field of chemical engineering .
among the most of the upper layers is , bitumen , compiled from the small stones , опущенных bitumen and then спрессованных .
while moving vehicles , and latch effort , this helps forces very well be distributed on the road to cover .
at асфальтовом cover , he added , placed last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear also requires the proper thickness , and you must take into consideration the material , from whom he is .
when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all strata of the cover , and therefore education yam .

if there is a theme , a decision on which ca n't take after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so it is energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that electoral meetings have become an occasion for reflection about the share of and place , their nuclear energy .
france must to build its opinion data on objective facts and , on the rational .
during the same period would be necessary to complete a growing deficit fossil resources constantly , to continue electricity production , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
here is why germany remains one in his decision to forgo nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - here is the only a few of those who strongly continues to their projects .
although the model germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes in as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; due to what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
price , which the majority of french refuse to pay more because , they do not oppose this type of energy , in principle .
heavily export - oriented , she attracts a плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs that cannot be moved in another industry .

then was administrative harassment of foreign students , which was in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) , said that france " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see in the burden for the french economy and immigration for french in society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов complementarity , existing between local and immigrants , leads that the arrival of the immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates great proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - all were founded immigrants ) .
world labor organization estimates that in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in the average 150 000 euros .
referred teeth , which used to scaring immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is this valuable acquisition ; but concurrently and fragile .
some believed that democracy had finally triumphed over their enemies , is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a prerequisite for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of repression " , as when something republican philosopher etienne вашро said .
european crisis , which we are experiencing , " this economic crisis , but in the first of all this political crisis and the crisis democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referenda , organized as the need and хаотическом alright .
there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness , and from lack of solidarity .
many worried about the transfer of sovereignty , europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with her each of her nations together .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , extricating itself from the markets , and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a long discussion of this all proposals the socialists and jacques delors now require the european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , the need was " create a " republicans .
it can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , the present popular european sovereignty .
in fact , 2011 will be completed 11 % rise in the world sales microprocessors ( bank cards , mobile phones with sim - cards ) , above , according to eurosmart , 6 thousand million units .

analysis occurred calls pointed out at several interlocutors , 58/89 in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this step forward , but , surely , we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before we talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years already known that the sect receives financial and идейную support from the outside and that she is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigeria researcher .
the international community headed by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to attention on boko haram , which creates problems .
she aims mainly in on the of the church , bars and the law enforcement authorities .
in the past christmas , she took on responsibility for the diluted share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then another for one in abuja .
in august of the local representation of the united nations becomes their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to continent .

entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the rankings , candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of affairs .

northern stream , new gate for entrance of russian gas in europe .
he is calculated on the supply natural gas equivalent of the 30 million of households .
more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and governments have participated in the last tuesday on the shores of the baltic sea , between orchestra and exquisite performance snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , a new gas pipeline , which connects directly to russia and germany under water .
on a new pipeline 27.5 thousand million additional cubic metres of gas will come every year in western europe for the first 1 224 km long pipeline connecting the leningrad region , with the earth of mecklenburg - pomerania .
pipeline and the possibility of buildings a third on the same direction have already discussed .
these two countries will lose part of their power : they become harder to influence russia , threatening to shut down access to western european markets .

" in case of an accident we close the flow of gas , less than a minute , " argues jens mueller .
but this seems unlikely that piping designers stitches , calculated on протечку only once in 100 000 years old .
сигароообразный аппарат introduced a 1 - meter diameter pipeline inside and pushed forward the flow of gas .
gas pipeline was designed to work in over 50 years , without the need for slightest repairs .
these five companies have created the joint venture , called the northern flow , who was commissioned to build and exploit gas pipeline .
then gazprom gave this company to rent on twenty years with the possibility of extension of the entire volume of gas transportation .
gas pipeline construction financing was provided on the 30 % of the shareholders and the 70 % of the banking loans .
gas pipeline extends from the baltic sea in the lubmin on the sandy beach , засаженный coniferous trees .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of gas , before siphoned his in the german gas pipelines .
at full capacity of this will be 3 million in the hour , but in 2012 6 million .
