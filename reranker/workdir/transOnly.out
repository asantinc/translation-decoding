stories about fraud , is common on the tests in the school and college .
mentors who must teach opposite , sent a message that lies and fraud finds acceptable .
within one day , studies show that you may lie 10 up to 200 times .
another survey showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes get acquainted with each other .
unlike game room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities in comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
is not worth from this draw the conclusion that liars difficult notice and it is hard to expose .
i spent several years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which easily learn and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts that men are more lie about themselves , while women -- about others , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the top of his body , when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , change their position in a certain way , or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complex question completely .
someone might use the " qualification language " , when the complex question : " well ... in truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

he explained that bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами , and other - low molecular weight called мальтенами , who , along a road to cover his typical вязкоупругое demeanor .
this means that resistance street asphalt is not a constant , and change during the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperatures , said specializing in chemical engineering .
among the most of the upper layers is bitumen compiled from small stones , опущенных bitumen and then спрессованных .
when vehicles and latch efforts , it helps forces very well be on the road covering .
on асфальтовом cover , he added , is the last layer , called a layer of wear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact sand also immersed in asphalt .
as part of pavement , which will get and distribute these efforts , wear also requires the proper thickness , and must be taken into account material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water into coverage and it 's impossible to leave , it raises размягчение all sectors of the cover , and therefore education yam .

according to the research and documentation of health economics institute , the daily compensation expenses in 2008 thousands of 11.3 million euros accounted for 5 percent from total expenditure on health care .
the average , which hides some deviation ; another study published in 2007 the site about career management monster.com , showed that 75 % of the 40,000 french workers surveyed said that they did n't take a single day of the hospital .
if we compare these figures with figures european neighbours , it seems that the french workers do not are more likely to take sick than workers any other country .
level of fraud due to the sick leave , is very low compared to " grey " employment .
law following the 2002 led to systematic verification of hospital lasting more than 45 days .
in the case of systematically проверяемых hospital sheets for more than 45 days from 1.2 million 11 % were " inappropriate or unfounded " , equivalent to 132 000 .

insee reduction figures , despite this , in second quarter , with the slump in 0.1 % of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) instead of stagnation .
germany , in turn , the growth of 0.5 % over the same period .
if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a very short discussion or under the influence of emotions , is energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that the election meeting become an occasion for reflection on share and place their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and rational data .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources to continue electricity production continuously , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from environmental debate .
this is why germany only one in its decision to renounce nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , are just few of those who strongly continues to their projects .
although german model based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind which carbon emissions and electricity prices 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than on average in europe .
as in a globalized economy the price of energy a key factor in competitiveness and service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefit from the cheap electricity in europe .
price majority of the french refuse to pay the more because they do not oppose this type of energy in principle .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a whole contemporaries specialized on international trade small and medium - sized enterprises and created many jobs that may not be moved to another industry .
any engineer - electrician will order epr , calculated to work 60 years old , if the planned closure of its maker ?
development of areva solutions with low - carbon , nuclear and renewable , shows взаимодополнимости sources of energy .
in france we have security organization , which runs edged and transparent control existing energy centers , like фламанвиль .
for 50 years atomic industry experienced three serious incident .
in chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error led to the tragedy .
nuclear industry will lessons from the accident , as learned from two previous .
as it is seen all specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift to competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when interior minister ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) said that france " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration burden to the french economy and for french society .
in its programme in francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration . "
as remind us economists ian goldin and jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants based on the view that they can to replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking wage declines .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - dynamic sectors , where training linked to the proposals work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants that the arrival of the immigrants , leads to positively affect wages local workers .
and it without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates is share naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - all were founded immigrants ) .
according to labor organization , for example , in germany , an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus costs ) an average of 150,000 euros .
referred to teeth , which used to scaring immigrants , given exactly opposite effect .
democracy is most valuable acquisition ; but also and delicate .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over its enemies , a vote and make it as direct as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become the " tool of suppression , " as when a republican philosopher etienne вашро .
the european crisis that we are experiencing , is the economic crisis , but first , this political crisis and crisis democracy .
we did n't win , demanding series of national referenda , anything by as needed and in хаотическом order .
no , we are dreaming not edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and constant - on and democracy , this time at the pan - european level .
whole europe subject to dictates markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer europe , but the entire europe gradually lose their sovereignty , and with it each of her nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , free from markets and prepare for future , investing in them .
after a long discussion of this proposals socialists and jacques delors now require all european economic government .
but represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
to install republic of france , needed to be " create " republican .
this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , real people 's european sovereignty .
in fact , 2011 the 11 % rise in the world sales microchips ( bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , above , according to the eurosmart , 6 thousand million .
this year in the world would be sold 460 million smart card бесконтактных against 320 million a year ago !
europe , which lagged for a long time from asia - pacific region , is now ahead in бесконтактных payments .
france starts off with more modest positions : in circulation are 400,000 бесконтактных visa cards .
this year , carrefour released 2.5 million бесконтактных pass mastercard .
